<small><i>Dangerous Business</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">T</span>OWARD sunset on the first day of June, a
small black car rattled past a crossroads sign in a
tiny village in northwestern France. The sign
pointed to the near-by town of Sainte M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise,
about two miles farther inland. The coast of the
English Channel was nearly three miles back in
the other direction.</p>

<p>Behind the wheel of the car sat a thin, anxious
Frenchman. Hunched beside him was a young,
blond Englishman. The younger man was shabbily
dressed, and most of the lower part of his face was
covered by a bandage.</p>

<p>The car pulled up and stopped in front of a
house with a weather-beaten sign on it which read:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pierre Gagnon</span> <i>Gas Tobacco Chocolate</i></p>

<p>A lone gas pump stood between the house and
the highway. Beyond the house lay Pierre Gagnon&#8217;s
farm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>The driver waited a moment and then honked
three times sharply. Almost immediately the door
opened. A dark-haired boy of about twelve came
out.</p>

<p>The man behind the wheel asked, &#8220;Is your father
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy nodded and politely explained, &#8220;If you
want gas I can work the pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver frowned nervously and repeated,
&#8220;Get your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the direction of Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise three
German soldiers came in sight, their heavy tread
echoing in the stillness of the drowsy village. Both
men in the car and the boy glanced at them. When
the boy did not move, the driver spoke more
sharply, &#8220;Your father, bring him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy turned and disappeared through the
door.</p>

<p>The driver and his passenger waited. The
younger man slid low in his seat, his back toward
the approaching soldiers.</p>

<p>Chatting among themselves, the Germans paid
no attention to the car nor to a girl of fifteen who
had come to the house door. Behind her stood her
father, Pierre Gagnon, a burly man with a thick
mustache, and rumpled country clothes.</p>

<p>He brushed past the girl, and at a signal from
the driver, went to the pump. The driver left his
seat and bent close to speak to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_005.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>At a signal from the driver he went to the pump</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Pierre Gagnon listened carefully, then swung
around and went back to the girl in the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;they want us to hide
this fellow, another downed flyer, for two or three
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl studied the youth slumped low in the
front seat. She thought, &#8220;He looks like all the airmen
who are shot down over France&mdash;the worried
eyes, the peasant clothes that don&#8217;t fit, the bandages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the driver?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;Has he the
right password?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; her father replied. &#8220;And he asks us to
hide this English pilot till the Maquis can find a
way to get him over the border into Spain. Do you
think we can do it?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In Normandy, that part of France which thrusts
northward into the English Channel, apple trees
were in bloom. Warm, soft breezes played across
the green fields, over the thick hedgerows, and
through the orchards.</p>

<p>But in this beautiful spring of 1944 the people
of Normandy could not enjoy what they saw. They
could only hear the tramp of German boots over
their land. Nazi armies had occupied France, and
for the last two years German camps had been set
up over the countryside. French property had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
been seized, and Nazi officers told the people exactly
what they could and could not do.</p>

<p>The town of Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise sits almost in the
middle of what is called the Cherbourg Peninsula.
Most of the Norman people are farmers or dairymen.
Some are fishermen, but the Nazis would not
let them fish. Instead, the Germans set up barriers
along the shore to prevent boats from landing.
And they lined the coast with huge guns. Also, the
fields were spiked with posts and barbed wire to
keep American and British gliders from landing.</p>

<p>For many months, the French people had been
expecting British and American armies to come in
a great invasion that would drive the Nazis out.
But their hopes had always failed. No troops had
come to liberate them, and the Normans felt glum
and often angry. More than anything else they
wanted to be free.</p>

<p>The only thing they could do was to cause all
possible trouble for the Nazis secretly. Those who
banded together in &#8220;Underground&#8221; or Resistance
groups were called Maquis. If a Maquis was
caught by the Germans he was very likely to be
shot.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many French ran the risk of being
detected helping the British and Americans. Even
very young men and girls operated in the secret
Underground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>The Nazis tried to watch everyone, but sometimes
the most innocent-looking car on the road
was being used to trick them, even in the quietest
village.</p>

<p>It was happening now. Marie Gagnon nodded
to her father. &#8220;Bring him in,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
get the room in the attic ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; her father said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send Andr&eacute;
out of the way first. What he doesn&#8217;t know he
won&#8217;t chatter about.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shouted through the door, &#8220;Andr&eacute;. Come
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a clatter of heavy shoes and the boy
reappeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Son,&#8221; his father said sternly, &#8220;have you taken
the eggs to old Schmidt yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; hesitated and shook his head. &#8220;No&mdash;my
bicycle&mdash;I could not get the chain fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>His sister snorted at him. &#8220;You are getting soft.
It won&#8217;t hurt you to walk. The eggs are on the
kitchen table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; thought, &#8220;Sisters!&#8221; But a look at his father&#8217;s
face sent him back for the eggs.</p>

<p>As he turned down the road toward Ste. M&egrave;re
&Eacute;glise his father went back to the gas pump. Andr&eacute;
had not gone far when Patchou, his dog,
caught up with him. The puppy gave him a playful
nudge as if to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to be late, but I
had to give that car a good, long sniff.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>After walking less than a mile, Andr&eacute; turned off
and came to a group of camouflaged barracks. Inside
the high wire fence, narrow buildings stood
in long rows. A German sentry, his rifle held
loosely, guarded the gate. He grinned at the boy
and waved him inside.</p>

<p>As Andr&eacute; entered, a Frenchman pedaling by on
an ancient bicycle shouted to him, but a burst of
Patchou&#8217;s barking drowned out the greeting.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; went around a large group of military vehicles
and mobile guns parked under a protecting
netted screen. Then he followed a winding path
up to one of the barracks.</p>

<p>Patchou, prancing ahead of him, leaped playfully
at a middle-aged German soldier seated on a
bench outside, puffing on his pipe.</p>

<p>Gently pushing off the excited dog, the German
saw Andr&eacute; and called, &#8220;Aha! It&#8217;s young Herr Gagnon.&#8221;
He tapped the ashes from his pipe and
then added, &#8220;You have brought Papa Schmidt
some more eggs, no?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; held out the package. The German
placed it on the bench and carefully unknotted
the big handkerchief the boy had brought.</p>

<p>Schmidt exclaimed when he saw the contents.
&#8220;<i>Ach!</i> and cheese, too.&#8221; He held the cheese to his
nose and inhaled deeply. &#8220;That&#8217;s goot. You are a
fine boy, Andr&eacute; Gagnon.&#8221; With a twinkling smile,
he added, &#8220;Almost as goot as my own Otto.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>&#8220;Look, I show you.&#8221; He reached into the pocket
of his tunic. &#8220;Just today a letter came from my
home in Osnabr&uuml;ck&mdash;and pictures.&#8221; Pointing to
one, he said, &#8220;That&#8217;s my Otto. He&#8217;s like you, no?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; studied the snapshot of a boy about his
own age but with light, almost white hair, frowning
into the sun.</p>

<p>A little embarrassed, Andr&eacute; could only say, &#8220;He
wears funny clothes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The German chuckled. &#8220;If he could see you,
he&#8217;d think yours were comical too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Glancing at the letter in his hand, he sighed.
&#8220;<i>Ach!</i> but they are having it bad in Osnabr&uuml;ck.
The Englisher and the Americaner planes they
bomb, bomb, bomb our town. Part of my home
is gone. My wife and boy say they get no sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost to himself he muttered, &#8220;When will the
war end?&#8221; Then, turning to the boy, he said sadly,
&#8220;<i>Ach</i>, how do you know, any more than me? We
smile, eh, while we can ... and enjoy the sunshine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patchou had wandered off to one of the other
barracks and started a fight with one of the camp
dogs. Andr&eacute; called over his shoulder, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back
again in a day or two,&#8221; and ran to separate the two
animals.</p>

<p>By the time he and Patchou reached home, the
last twilight had faded. The house was dark, for
blackout curtains were drawn across the windows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Inside, his sister sat hunched alone in the wide,
stone-floored kitchen, listening to music from a
forbidden radio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Papa?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>Marie looked annoyed. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone off with Victor
Lescot. That Raoul Cotein is making trouble
again. Now he says our cows broke into his pasture.
What an old weasel he is! Even the Germans
behave better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later, with supper over, she paused suddenly,
and raised her hand for Andr&eacute; to be silent.</p>

<p>Breaking the stillness, the weird wail of air-raid
sirens rose far away.</p>

<p>Marie looked tired. And there was fear in her
eyes when she heard the sirens, which meant that
another air raid was beginning.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Again</i> tonight,&#8221; she sighed, &#8220;and so early. It is
not yet ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went to the kitchen window and made sure
the black curtains let no light through.</p>

<p>&#8220;You run upstairs, Andr&eacute;, and see that the curtains
there are tight. And stay with Mother,&#8221; she
ordered.</p>

<p>Mme. Gagnon had been ill for several weeks.
Now she lay in her big bed upstairs, nearly asleep.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes as the sirens died away and
then began again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, son,&#8221; she said, &#8220;did you eat a good supper?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Andr&eacute; nodded.</p>

<p>A little wind from the sea had sprung up, and
somewhere a loose board rattled. Also, there was a
noise in the attic. &#8220;Must be a rat,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said to
himself, and decided to take Patchou up there
tomorrow. &#8220;He&#8217;ll have some fun catching that little
thief,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>His mother was roused again by the drone of
plane engines coming in high overhead. Their
lofty beating made the air tremble. Antiaircraft
guns in near-by Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise began to boom.
Their hollow <i>wumpf, wumpf</i>, added to the din of
the sirens.</p>

<p>In a slight lull, Mme. Gagnon asked, &#8220;Is your
father home? I do not like him to be away when
there is an air raid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; shook his head and raised his voice above
the racket. &#8220;He&#8217;s out with Victor. Marie says
Raoul Cotein is trying to stir up trouble again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wanted his mother to think of something
other than the air raid, so he laughed and added,
&#8220;Marie says Raoul is a weasel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Raoul Cotein&#8217;s mischief-making was a village
joke.</p>

<p>Mme. Gagnon sighed. &#8220;I wish your father
would come home,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The bombing
might be bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said wisely. &#8220;These are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
English planes. The Americans only come in the
daytime. You know, Maman, there aren&#8217;t any big
guns and bridges and war factories close to us
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>But bombs were dropping, though at a distance.
Several minutes later, the coastal guns were still
firing, but the sound of the engines had begun to
die away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Mme. Gagnon in a relieved
voice. &#8220;You were right, Andr&eacute;, they dropped no
bombs on us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; heard his sister&#8217;s footsteps on the stairs.
Then he thought he heard the creak of the attic
door. Presently she came bustling into the room,
carrying a small tray with a pot of chocolate and a
cup.</p>

<p>Cheerfully, she said, &#8220;There, Maman, they&#8217;ve
gone. Let&#8217;s hope we get no more planes tonight.
Here,&#8221; pouring the chocolate, &#8220;drink this and try
to get back to sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her dark skirts swished around her knees as she
fluffed up her mother&#8217;s pillows and tucked in the
coverlet.</p>

<p>Downstairs the front door opened and they
heard Pierre Gagnon calling, &#8220;Marie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then someone spoke in another voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh-h,&#8221; whispered Marie. &#8220;There is someone
with Papa.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>Her father was saying loudly, &#8220;Yes, Herr Kapitan,
I&#8217;m all right. No, no, it is not necessary for
you to come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Marie and Andr&eacute; reached the head of
the stairs, the outside door was slammed, bolted,
and the stranger had gone.</p>

<p>The light from the hall lamp fell on their father
as he turned to face the stairs.</p>

<p>Across one of his cheeks stretched a deep red
gash.</p>

<small><i>House-to-House Search</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>S THE light fell across the wound on her father&#8217;s
face Marie cried out sharply.</p>

<p>From the bedroom Mme. Gagnon called,
&#8220;Marie, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; ran back to her side. &#8220;Papa&#8217;s hurt,&#8221; he
said, and then added hastily, &#8220;but not badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there were no bombs,&#8221; Mme. Gagnon exclaimed.</p>

<p>Pierre himself had lunged up the stairs and now
burst into the bedroom sputtering, &#8220;Don&#8217;t excite
yourself, Maman. All is well. No harm is done.
That <i>cochon</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; his wife cried. &#8220;So, it <i>was</i> Raoul Cotein!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who else but that son of Satan?&#8221; Gagnon&#8217;s eyes
snapped fiercely. He was red and breathing furiously,
and flung himself into a chair beside the
bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;I contain myself,&#8221; he said firmly, clamping
both great hands on his knees like thunderclaps.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Papa,&#8221; Andr&eacute; grasped his arm, &#8220;do not
contain yourself yet. Tell us what has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; said Mme. Gagnon, &#8220;run get some hot
water and clean Papa&#8217;s cut.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie clattered quickly down the stairs and
Mme. Gagnon went on, &#8220;Now, Pierre, you get
yourself slashed and perhaps poisoned over a cow.
I thought you had more sense.&#8221;</p>

<p>The farmer stiffened. &#8220;It was <i>not</i> about a cow!
Raoul sent for me only as an excuse. Ask Victor.
He also was there. At once Raoul began to scream
so loud, if it were not for the guns booming they
could have heard him in Ste. M&egrave;re.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&mdash;?&#8221; began Mme. Gagnon impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; cried Pierre, &#8220;he began to shout
charges against me.&#8221; He swept out both arms.
&#8220;Against all of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre swallowed angrily. &#8220;He accused me,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;of being a collaborator of the Nazis! He
accuses us all&mdash;you, Marie, Andr&eacute;&mdash;of working
hand in glove with them. It seems that only this
evening he saw Andr&eacute;, here, entering the German
camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>There it was&mdash;the black word, <i>collaborator</i>, he
who helps the enemy! It meant someone hated by
all Frenchmen, more, perhaps, than the enemy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>&#8220;But Papa,&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried angrily, &#8220;poor old
Schmidt! He is not an enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre shook his head. &#8220;He is. We have only
been giving him a few eggs and a little cheese because
he is a tired old man. But Raoul can make
it sound wrong if he wants to.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Mme. Gagnon nodded encouragement. She
thought of the many Allied flyers this brave, shaggy
man had secretly helped to escape from the Nazis
at the risk of his life. And of the boy in the attic.
She glanced at her son, who, so far, knew nothing
about his father&#8217;s and sister&#8217;s work in the Underground.</p>

<p>&#8220;I grew very angry when he called me a collaborator,&#8221;
Pierre went on. &#8220;How could I let anyone
say such a thing to me? I punched Raoul and he
came back at me like a bull. We fell down, and my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
face struck the stone wall. The result is not pretty,
perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did that German captain come home
with you?&#8221; Andr&eacute; burst out. &#8220;Did he get in the
fight with Raoul?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gagnon snorted. &#8220;Not in the fight. Unfortunately
he came along just as Raoul picked up a
stick and started for me. Victor was yelling at
both of us, and suddenly we saw the German coming.
Naturally we all shut our mouths like clams.
Frenchmen do not fight Frenchmen in front of
the Nazis&mdash;not even Raoul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there will be no more to it,&#8221; said
Mme. Gagnon soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If they do not send soldiers to snoop around
the house,&#8221; Pierre grunted, &#8220;we need not worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie returned, breathless, with a basin of water
and clean cloths. Her father sat on the edge of
the bed, repeating the story, while the cut was
cleaned and gently covered with ointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your face feels better, Pierre?&#8221; Mme. Gagnon
asked. &#8220;Good. Now we must all sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes later the house was dark. Everywhere,
from the kitchen where Andr&eacute; snuggled
into his goosedown-soft, curtained bed, to the attic,
there was the sound of quiet breathing. And
in the attic the English boy turned restlessly on his
narrow cot.</p>

<p>Before dawn the household roused to the day&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
duties. It was not long before they heard news.
The weary, older German soldiers were being removed.
War-toughened young Nazis were going
to take over the district.</p>

<p>Before the new troops had been in camp two
days, proclamations that put stricter limits on freedom
were posted everywhere.</p>

<p>A curfew was ordered. People must not leave
their houses between ten in the evening and five
in the morning. This did not bother Andr&eacute; since
he usually went to bed well before ten.</p>

<p>A sad little good-by note from Papa Schmidt
reached him. It thanked the family warmly for
their kindness and ended: &#8220;Be a goot boy. Someday
I bring my Otto to see you. <i>Auf Wiederzehen.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; noticed that the German camp was a
changed place. The new regiment had chained
vicious police dogs inside the wire fence. And
Andr&eacute; was horrified when he heard that stray
dogs belonging to the village people had been
shot.</p>

<p>He tied Patchou safely in the farmyard at the
rear of the house, and kept an eye on him.</p>

<p>Then came another dreaded order:</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<p>ALL ARTICLES OF BRASS OR COPPER MUST BE<br />
SURRENDERED BY THE CIVILIAN POPULATION. A<br />
HOUSE-TO-HOUSE SEARCH WILL BE MADE.</p>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s most prized possession was a gleaming
brass trumpet which he had learned to play with
some skill. It was not only dear to him, but the
only really precious thing he owned. &#8220;I must hide
it in some very, very safe place,&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>Also, the coming search would be very dangerous
to the rest of the family. If the Germans came
they would surely find the flyer in their attic. And
if an enemy pilot were found in their house they
would all be shot.</p>

<p>Marie and her father had been watching for the
Maquis operator to come for the flyer, according
to plan. But for some reason he had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those Maquis! They are wasting their time
in some caf&eacute;, enjoying themselves, probably,&#8221;
Mme. Gagnon said irritably.</p>

<p>But Pierre replied, &#8220;No. Not the Maquis.
There is some good reason why the operator has
not yet been able to get here.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until June 4th, just before curfew
time, that a Maquis messenger slipped into the
Gagnon house.</p>

<p>He said he could not come before because the
new Nazi garrison had sent patrols everywhere.</p>

<p>The plans of the Underground had all been
changed. Pierre and Marie, he said, must keep the
flyer where he was until new arrangements to
spirit him away could be made.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>That evening Marie and her father huddled in
the dark little parlor to talk over their situation.</p>

<p>Marie whispered wildly, &#8220;What <i>shall</i> we do if
the Nazis come here? They will go to the attic
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre shrugged, scowling. &#8220;We must find some
way. We always have before.&#8221;</p>

<p>But, more than an hour later, they still had no
idea what to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other way,&#8221; whispered M. Gagnon
at last, &#8220;but to go ask Father Duprey to offer some
idea. He must be taken into the secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie nodded.</p>

<p>The night was dark and rain began to fall.</p>

<p>Her father yawned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go see Father Duprey
tomorrow, first thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now off to bed
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rose, and stood tensely, startled by a creak
on the stairs and soft, padding footsteps outside
the door.</p>

<p>The door opened and Andr&eacute; stood there,
clutching his boots and his trumpet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens, Andr&eacute;, you frightened us,&#8221; Marie
snapped. &#8220;We thought you were in bed long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>His father asked gruffly, &#8220;Where are you going
at this hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy moved nervously. &#8220;Papa,&#8221; he blurted,
&#8220;why didn&#8217;t you tell me that man was hiding in
the attic?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Pierre and his daughter exchanged quick
glances. Pierre put a hand protectingly on his
son&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;We thought it might save trouble
if you didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But now it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why shouldn&#8217;t I know?&#8221; Andr&eacute; demanded
stubbornly. &#8220;He&#8217;s the man with the bandage who
came in the car a few days ago, isn&#8217;t he? I talked
to him. And I like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be sure not to give us away,&#8221; Andr&eacute;&#8217;s
father ordered sternly. &#8220;Say nothing about this
man to anyone. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; promised, and he laid his trumpet beside
the lamp. &#8220;I found him up there when I went
to the attic to get this. I must bury it outside somewhere
before the Nazis come snooping around.&#8221;
Then he gasped. &#8220;But won&#8217;t they find Ronald?&#8221;</p>

<p>His father said, &#8220;Your sister and I are looking
out for him. Now, about this trumpet...?&#8221;</p>

<p>The horn <i>had</i> to be hidden before another
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bury it near the fence beside the lane,&#8221;
Andr&eacute; whispered as he edged out into the stormy
darkness.</p>

<p>An eerie stillness hung heavy on Marie and her
father when Andr&eacute; had gone.</p>

<p>After a few moments Marie whispered nervously,
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I can sleep until this is settled,
Papa. Don&#8217;t you think you could slip out and
see Father Duprey tonight?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>Pierre frowned. &#8220;What about this cursed curfew?
I do not want to be caught. However, it will
not be my first night job for the Underground.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped on his coat, pulled his cap low, and
eased himself noiselessly out of the house.</p>

<p>Marie sat alone, her eyes on the clock.</p>

<p>Her heart jumped a beat when an approaching
patrol car whizzed down the road. It passed the
house. Again the dark silence.</p>

<p>The back door opened and Andr&eacute; returned, his
boots caked high with mud. When he asked,
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Papa?&#8221; she said, &#8220;He has gone out. Ask
no more questions and go to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait for Papa,&#8221; he replied firmly, and
perched on the edge of a chair, studying his sister&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>He had felt excitement growing among the
others in the house. Now it belonged to him, too.</p>

<p>They listened for outside noises through the
sounds of the storm. Andr&eacute; said, &#8220;Ronald Pitt&#8217;s
a fighter pilot, Marie. Did you know that?</p>

<p>&#8220;I never talked to one before,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;He told me his Spitfire plane got hit, late one
evening, and he parachuted down into a wood.
The Germans didn&#8217;t find him. He&#8217;s been hiding
in the fields and towns for two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie nodded. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of the lucky ones&mdash;so
far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; chattered softly on. &#8220;Those bandages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
were a fake, weren&#8217;t they? He wasn&#8217;t really hurt.
Somebody painted his jaw with iodine and put on
those bandages so he wouldn&#8217;t have to talk to any
Germans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes on the clock, Marie said, &#8220;Shush now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; broke the next few minutes of silence
with, &#8220;Ronald comes from Nottingham, like
Robin Hood&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But Marie hissed, &#8220;Shh-h!&#8221; still more sharply,
and rose to listen at the door.</p>

<p>At a rap outside, she unfastened the lock.</p>

<p>Pierre slipped inside. His tired face had lighted
up, and Marie smiled. &#8220;Father Duprey will help
us!&#8221; she cried eagerly.</p>

<p>Pierre motioned to the stairs and said, &#8220;We go
talk to Maman quickly. Come, Marie. You,
Andr&eacute;, clothes off and into bed. Lamps out,
Marie.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Mme. Gagnon&#8217;s bedside a candle flickered.
Pierre and Marie drew close beside the pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Nazis have already begun to search houses
on the other road,&#8221; Pierre whispered rapidly.
&#8220;They are still a long way from us, but we can&#8217;t
lose any time. Father Duprey has a plan. It is this.
He will arrange with the hospital at St. Sauveur le
Vicomte tomorrow for you to go there in an ambulance
to have treatments. And we will hide the
English flyer inside the ambulance.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a frightened look from Mme. Gagnon, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
went on hurriedly, &#8220;Marie will ride with you, and
Father Duprey will sit up with the driver. He
thinks if we make a big parade of it the Germans
will not be so suspicious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But St. Sauveur is beyond Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise
... so far away,&#8221; whispered Mme. Gagnon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that is good, Maman,&#8221; Marie protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the nut of the whole idea!&#8221; Pierre&#8217;s voice
rose excitedly. &#8220;St. Sauveur is out of this district,
and you will be safely away from these new Nazi
troops. Some Maquis will meet us near the hospital.
They will spirit our flyer out of the ambulance
and hide him until he can be moved on. It is a
good plan, Maman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not like it,&#8221; she protested.</p>

<small><i>Father Duprey&#8217;s Plan</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">E</span>VEN next morning when Father Duprey arrived
to go over the plan again, Mme. Gagnon was
still protesting uneasily.</p>

<p>Father Duprey clasped his hands, beaming.
&#8220;Think of the good that will come to all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie&#8217;s mother nodded her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>The next step after preparing Mme. Gagnon
for her role was to instruct the flyer in his part.</p>

<p>Leaving Marie on watch downstairs, Pierre and
the priest, trailed by Andr&eacute;, clumped up the dark
staircase to the attic.</p>

<p>Ronald Pitt listened to them quietly and
shrugged when Father Duprey asked, &#8220;You agree,
my son? It is a good scheme, you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m in your hands,&#8221; the young Englishman
replied. &#8220;But I&#8217;d certainly feel foul if I got
you into trouble. Of course, I&#8217;m willing to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
any kind of chance. The sooner I get back to my
squadron the better. I think you can guess what&#8217;s
up in England. It&#8217;s my bet the invasion is coming
any day now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t come too soon,&#8221; Pierre said eagerly.</p>

<p>Soon after that, work on the farm began as on an
ordinary day. In spite of the Gagnons&#8217; desire to appear
untroubled, however, they paused often to
listen and look around them.</p>

<p>Rumors of the Nazi search party reached them
from all sides. The village women trundled from
house to house bemoaning the loss of their copper
cooking pots.</p>

<p>At two o&#8217;clock that afternoon the priest&#8217;s housekeeper
brought a package. A message said that all
arrangements had been completed. At exactly four
o&#8217;clock the ambulance would arrive before
Pierre&#8217;s house. Mme. Gagnon was to be ready to
leave instantly. The party must arrive at a point
near the hospital at <i>exactly</i> five o&#8217;clock.</p>

<p>Marie packed clothes for her mother and laid
out her own best dress. Even though she would be
returning that same evening, she also prepared a
small lunch basket. The hospital was only about
eighteen miles away, but food might be difficult to
find and expensive to buy.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was given the job of coaching Ronald
Pitt. He climbed the attic stairs filled with excitement
but also full of laughter. For the disguise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
that Father Duprey had chosen for the flyer was a
nun&#8217;s outfit of clothing.</p>

<p>When the young Englishman had put on the
long, full, black robe, Andr&eacute; stood back and studied
him, his eyes dancing. And from under the
starched headdress that framed his narrow face
the flyer&#8217;s blue eyes danced just as gaily.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; said, &#8220;You make a pretty nun.&#8221; And grinning,
he finished, &#8220;I did not think Spitfire pilots
were so <i>chic</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then recalling the serious instructions his
father had given him for Ronald, he repeated
them. &#8220;Be ready to come downstairs just before
four o&#8217;clock. Get into the ambulance quickly,
right after they put Maman&#8217;s stretcher in. The
family will try to surround you. The driver is a
Maquis and he&#8217;s used to this kind of business.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Andr&eacute; finished, &#8220;my father says to be
sure you don&#8217;t leave anything behind you for
the Germans to find. And Marie will come in
a few minutes to put the cot and all this stuff
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid.&#8221; Ronald looked down at the boy.
&#8220;I&#8217;d hate to see <i>my</i> young brother exposed to all
this danger you&#8217;re so cheerful about. Well, now I
must practice a bit.&#8221; He took a sedate turn between
the cot and the window, grinning at the
French boy. And he practiced sitting down demurely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>It had been raining gustily all day but stopped
about three, and the wind dropped.</p>

<p>For some time the village had been quiet&mdash;the
Nazi squad busy among outlying farms.</p>

<p>As four o&#8217;clock neared, Mme. Gagnon was upstairs,
dressed and wrapped in a shawl, ready to be
hurried onto the stretcher.</p>

<p>In the shuttered little parlor, a dark-robed figure
stood in the shadow beside the hallway door.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood watch at a window on the road, and
his father and Marie paced the stone-floored
kitchen.</p>

<p>Then, electrically, the silence was broken by
the rumble of an approaching car. Andr&eacute; drew the
curtain aside a little.</p>

<p>At his stifled cry Marie and her father rushed to
the window.</p>

<p>A German army truck crammed with armed
soldiers was slowing up on the road. And at that
same moment, from the opposite direction, the
closed black ambulance rolled up to the Gagnon
door.</p>

<p>Almost before the ambulance had braked to a
stop Father Duprey&#8217;s tall, erect figure swung down
from the front seat, and Pierre rushed to admit
him. The driver immediately began to back the
long vehicle close to the door.</p>

<p>Marie cried softly, &#8220;Heavens, Father, what a
calamity! The Nazis! What can we do?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;We can act sensible,&#8221; said Father Duprey,
&#8220;and waste no time moaning about what we can&#8217;t
help. Those men are evidently going to search the
Julliard farm next door before they come here.
Let the driver in with the stretcher, daughter, so
we lose no time getting Mme. Gagnon away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver sidled in and M. Gagnon seized the
stretcher. The two men hurried up the stairs.</p>

<p>A few seconds later the creaking steps warned
Andr&eacute; that his mother was being carried down.
He signaled Ronald to be ready for his dash.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Father Duprey to Marie, &#8220;sob a
little, but not enough to draw much attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; held the door while the little procession
puffed and brushed through. Mme. Gagnon was
lifted easily in through the ambulance door. And
a moment later, Ronald, clutching his awkward
bundle of skirts as naturally as he could, climbed
in and crouched beside the stretcher. His face was
hidden by the width of his headdress, and he bent
gently over the sick woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all going like clockwork, madame,&#8221; he
whispered. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; murmured Mme. Gagnon,
&#8220;more for Pierre, for Marie and Andr&eacute;....&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing by the road, Pierre looked with
mounting anxiety at the soldiers prowling through
the farm next door. They were not spending much
time there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>In all his later life Andr&eacute; never forgot the next
few minutes.</p>

<p>Mme. Gagnon called, &#8220;Pierre! Pierre, please
come with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just then Raoul Cotein bicycled briskly
up, shouting, &#8220;<i>Mon Dieu</i>, Gagnon, what are you
up to now?&#8221;</p>

<p>He set his bicycle against the wall and stared
into the open end of the ambulance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble here?&#8221; he demanded loudly
as his eyes rolled toward the strange nun.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get on with your business, Raoul,&#8221; M.
Gagnon ordered. &#8220;My wife is ill, as you well know,
and you are not needed here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Duprey&#8217;s black eyes were traveling
swiftly from the hunched figures in the dimness of
the ambulance to the Germans only two or three
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; boosted Marie in beside her mother, and
M. Gagnon closed the door upon them. Father
Duprey said calmly, &#8220;You may as well come along,
Pierre. It will comfort your wife. I&#8217;ll see that you
and Marie get home tonight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Andr&eacute;&mdash;&#8221; Pierre whispered.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; tugged at his arm. &#8220;Go. Go, Papa,&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;I can take care of everything&mdash;only go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down the road, the Nazis were piling back into
their truck and the starter whined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>He opened the door to find a Nazi officer
frowning at him</i></p>

<p>Father Duprey seized Pierre&#8217;s arm and whipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
him swiftly forward and up to the seat in front.</p>

<p>He had no more than slid into the seat himself
when the Maquis driver rocked the old ambulance
into action with a crash of gears. The machine
swayed into a turn and roared away toward Ste.
M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; watched it go for a long minute.</p>

<p>The German army truck started, but halted a
little distance off, and the sharp voice of the officer
giving commands drifted toward them.</p>

<p>Raoul Cotein shifted his feet. &#8220;Uh&mdash;I have
things to do,&#8221; he cried suddenly. He flung a leg
over his bicycle, and peddling furiously, was soon
gone.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; moved idly toward the house. Once
through his own door, the boy trotted quickly
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>He untied his dog and put him in the dimly lit
cow barn. As he snapped the door fastening, he
spoke warningly, &#8220;Not a sound out of you,
Patchou. Remember!&#8221;</p>

<p>He got back into the house just in time to answer
a loud thumping at the front door. He
opened it to find a Nazi officer and several hard-faced
soldiers frowning down at him.</p>

<small><i>Midnight Landing</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>NDR&Eacute; stepped quickly aside as, without a
word, the Germans tramped in.</p>

<p>Three of them were ordered upstairs while the
others set to work poking into every cupboard and
drawer on the first floor. When they had emptied
the kitchen of its copper they trooped off to the
outbuildings.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; waited uncertainly in the hallway at first.
Later, he edged his way to the farmyard door and
anxiously watched the search through the barns.
Not until he saw that none of the men went toward
the lane where his trumpet was buried did
he begin to breathe easily.</p>

<p>At last, the officer came from the loft over the
cow barn, shouting to his men to return to the
truck.</p>

<p>He strode into the kitchen and asked Andr&eacute;,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
&#8220;Your father and mother&mdash;where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all gone to the hospital with my
mother, who is sick,&#8221; Andr&eacute; explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, when your father returns,&#8221; the
officer snapped, &#8220;tell him I am putting men with
machine guns in that loft overlooking the road.
And advise him that it will do no good to protest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s heart sank. What would the family do
with a lot of Nazis underfoot? Did they suspect
that the Gagnons had been working with the Underground?</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, he felt desperately alone.
He nodded silently.</p>

<p>When the Germans had gone&mdash;with his mother&#8217;s
copper kettles&mdash;Andr&eacute; ran back to the barn.
Patchou lay in his dark corner under a manger, as
quiet as a mouse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come into the house, Patchou,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to keep you there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an hour or so Andr&eacute; went about doing his
father&#8217;s chores and his own. The heavy, low-lying
clouds began breaking a little.</p>

<p>He had just finished milking the cows when the
German truck returned with a dozen rough-looking
gunners and the sharp-faced officer. Machine
guns were unloaded and hauled up the stone loft
steps.</p>

<p>Some time later the officer and some of the men
piled into the truck and drove away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;They must have left at least six up there,&#8221;
Andr&eacute; said to himself. He must go up the road
later, and warn his father and Marie about the
hidden gunners.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_036.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>He opened the front window so that he might
be warned of an approaching car.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; ate the cold supper Marie had left under
a cloth for him. The minutes dragged by. By nine
o&#8217;clock there had been no sign of his father and
sister, and no word. For a while he sat on the floor
beside his dog. Tomorrow was June 6th&mdash;Patchou&#8217;s
first birthday. Andr&eacute; hoped Marie
would keep her promise to bring back some sort
of toy to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>When the clock struck ten he went out into the
deepening twilight to stare into the gloom toward
Ste. M&egrave;re. What if the Nazis had opened the ambulance
and found Ronald? Perhaps the Maquis
had failed to meet them.... He tried not to think
of such things.</p>

<p>Now it was eleven o&#8217;clock and long past time to
go to bed. From several directions there was strong
antiaircraft firing, and the echo of bombs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>In spite of the curfew order, Andr&eacute; began to
walk stealthily down the road. Those Nazi gunners
might open fire on any vehicle bringing his
family home.</p>

<p>Halting, listening, he picked his way to a bend
of the highway. After a little while he began to
realize how tired he was.</p>

<p>Drowsily he looked for a sheltered spot in the
hedge, and sank down among the ferns and the
tall grass. The rich smell of earth and spring
growth rose around him. A few fields away a horse
whinnied, and from far in the distance came the
long, high-fluted note of a train whistle....</p>

<p>Some time later he awoke with a start, and wondered
where he was and how long he had slept.
All around him hung thick, velvety blackness.</p>

<p>Something had wakened him. It was the sirens
and fire alarms in Ste. M&egrave;re.</p>

<p>And then he heard the planes.</p>

<p>Drumming overhead, throbbing so that the
earth shook under his feet, he heard them coming.</p>

<p>Then he saw them. A brilliant moon outlined
their wings.</p>

<p>He ran across the road and struggling through
a hedge, scrambled quickly up the tallest of a
clump of trees.</p>

<p>And now he saw that the planes were coming in
from the west, lower than he had ever seen them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
fly. They were twin-motored, scooping below the
clouds to right and left, filling the sky.</p>

<p>They were bombing Normandy! Ste. M&egrave;re!
Perhaps a bomb would drop on him&mdash;NOW!</p>

<p>The din of the German guns was incessant, and
the roar of the plane engines was deafening. He
must descend and find a ditch. His arms ached,
but he could not let go. He had climbed as high as
there were limbs to support him, and now he
clung to the solid trunk.</p>

<p>He noticed one particular plane coming directly
toward him. It was etched sharply against a luminous
patch of cloud, and he could clearly see the
three white stripes that banded each wing.</p>

<p>As he watched, he saw the open door at the rear
of the fuselage, and instantly something dark
dropped from it. Then another dark blob and another.</p>

<p>Expecting the whistle of bombs, he shut his
eyes, pressed his face into the rough bark, and
prayed....</p>

<p>After a few seconds he opened his eyes.</p>

<p>Other than the guns and the throttled beat of
the engines, there had been no sound. No bombs
were exploding.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; threw his head back and glanced quickly
skyward. In the moonlight, speckled in every direction
across the sky, hung hundreds of mushroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
shapes that were floating gently earthward
as silently as apple petals.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw that they were parachutes!</p>

<p>And below nearly every one, a soldier swung.
From the lowest he could make out the jut of rifles.</p>

<small><i>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s Warning</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">C</span>LINGING to his uncertain perch, for the first
few seconds Andr&eacute; felt stunned. Could this be his
own Normandy sky? He watched the flicker of
moonlight here and there on the parachutes drifting
down through the scudding clouds.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Invasion!&#8221; he thought.</p>

<p>He had turned to stare across at his father&#8217;s barn
in the distance, wondering about the Nazi machine
gunners, when the tree beside him was torn
by a crashing of branches. His heart leaped into
his throat. The topmost branches were entwined
by a great, pale, crumpled parachute. And, dangling
from the shroud lines, hung a figure that
swung like a pendulum.</p>

<p>In the meadow beyond, other dark shapes were
pelting into the hayfield, their chutes collapsing
around them like punctured balloons.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>The noise was spreading. Isolated shots and
short bursts of machine-gun fire drummed,
stopped, and drummed again. From the far-off
German camp near Ste. M&egrave;re came the wail of a
Klaxon horn. And there was the distant growl and
whine of speeding motors. The echo of distant
explosions increased.</p>

<p>High overhead, planes whose cargo had been
dropped, droned away toward England. And
everywhere antiaircraft fire was spitting even more
frantically.</p>

<p>Who were these men dangling from parachutes?
If they had started the Invasion, all Maquis ought
to help them. &#8220;Then that means me, too,&#8221; Andr&eacute;
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>He braced his foot in the crotch of the tree,
lowered the other to feel his way down.</p>

<p>He dropped to another branch&mdash;and it
snapped!</p>

<p>Just then the moon sailed from under a cloud
and touched him as brightly as a searchlight.</p>

<p>A hoarse cry came from a few feet away. &#8220;Look
out! Sniper in that tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; saw the glint of the gun barrel swinging
up toward him.</p>

<p>But a louder voice from the man dangling in
the tree shouted, &#8220;<i>Hold it.</i> Hold it, Slim. It&#8217;s just a
kid. I can see him. Don&#8217;t shoot. Say, somebody
come over here and cut me down.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_042.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s stiffened body relaxed, and he began
to feel his way among the dim branches. Several
men had gathered at the foot of the tree, whispering,
and one of them lifted his voice angrily.
&#8220;What&#8217;s a kid doin&#8217; in a tree this time of night?
Something funny here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay. <i>Okay.</i> We&#8217;ll find out. But get me down
before this harness cuts me in two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; called, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot me. I&#8217;m coming
down. I want to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slithered more quickly now from limb to
limb, and jumped. Instantly a flashlight blinded
him, and a drawling voice said, &#8220;Well, what d&#8217;ya
know! A little shrimp!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flashlight had been turned to the ground.
As soon as his eyes had grown accustomed to it,
Andr&eacute; gaped at the men. Never had he seen such
frightening figures: torn uniforms, faces blackened
with soot, each one bristling with every kind of
small arm and grenade, topped off by helmets
festooned with leafy twigs.</p>

<p>He gasped in amazement. &#8220;Are you Americans?&#8221;</p>

<p>The most tattered of the men grinned. &#8220;Sure.
Who you expecting? Say, how come you&#8217;re talking
English?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister and I learned a lot of English from
Father Duprey,&#8221; Andr&eacute; replied, &#8220;just in case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Case of what?&#8221; demanded the suspicious one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>&#8220;To help you when you came,&#8221; said Andr&eacute;.
&#8220;But sir, shouldn&#8217;t we get that man up there out
of the tree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time!&#8221; came from the branches near
by.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; shinnied quickly up above the dangling
trooper and disentangled the chute. A moment
later the chutist was on the ground, unstrapping
his Tommy gun.</p>

<p>A stocky, bristling soldier had been looking out
over the highway uneasily. Now he said, &#8220;Say,
Slim, we gotta get movin&#8217;. We&#8217;re supposed to get
to the causeways across the flooded part. Give &#8217;em
the signal, Risso.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly then, Andr&eacute; heard a little rasping cricket-sound
that was repeated almost at once from the
meadow.</p>

<p>More helmeted men crept up to the group.
They said, &#8220;Hi, Sarge, what now?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stocky sergeant had been studying the
darkened scene around him. Now he said, &#8220;We&#8217;re
too far inland.&#8221; He looked down at Andr&eacute;. &#8220;Listen,
kid. You really mean you want to help us
Americans&mdash;you aren&#8217;t up to no tricks?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; frowned. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting to help for
a long time. It is my country here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant&#8217;s face softened a little. &#8220;Okay, I
believe you. But listen. Where&#8217;s your folks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My family has gone away,&#8221; Andr&eacute; explained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
&#8220;But they&#8217;ll be home soon. What do you want me
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You just tell us how far it is to the nearest road
across that lagoon&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; interrupted excitedly, &#8220;First, I must tell
you, there are at least six Nazis in our barn. They
have machine guns trained on the road. I&#8217;ll show
you the way around the back wall. You could
catch them from behind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant stiffened. &#8220;You, Slim, stay here
with the kid, out of range&mdash;and both of you <i>keep
down</i>,&#8221; he ordered.</p>

<p>Several shapes moved quietly off into the black
field.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked up at the gray shape of the lean,
rangy fellow slouched against a tree. The soldier
held his Tommy gun easily. A thumb was hooked
in the belt festooned with grenades, and a wicked-looking
sheath knife was strapped to his leg.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; cleared his throat and asked, &#8220;Slim&mdash;is
this the&mdash;Invasion?&#8221;</p>

<p>The paratrooper smiled. &#8220;Well, son,&#8221; he
drawled, &#8220;it&#8217;s a start, anyhow. Quite a parcel of
us has been dropped from Heaven, and I reckon
there&#8217;ll be an awful lot more tomorrow when the
gliders get in. All I know is, son, I&#8217;m a long, long
way from Pecos, Texas.&#8221;</p>

<p>After that, for a moment, Andr&eacute; thought the
man was going to sleep. Presently he noticed that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the trooper&#8217;s face was half turned away and that
he was listening intently.</p>

<p>A dog barked, and Andr&eacute; cried softly, &#8220;That&#8217;s
my Patchou. The men must be coming into our
farmyard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, an explosion of shots, grenades, and
hoarse shouts came from the direction of the
house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got &#8217;em,&#8221; sighed Slim. &#8220;They&#8217;re good, our
boys are. Especially at that sneaky stuff. Better
keep down there. Might be bullets flyin&#8217; &#8217;round.
I <i>do not</i> like flyin&#8217; bullets.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the racket continued, the two stretched out
among the ferns. &#8220;May&#8217;s well rest,&#8221; Slim murmured
drowsily. &#8220;Doubt if there&#8217;s gonna be much
time from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later there was a crackling in
the hedge, from a direction away from the farm.</p>

<p>Slim shot into action like a snake, Tommy gun
aimed, body tense. The faint sounds continued.
After a moment Slim called, &#8220;Halt! You out there.
Stay where you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>A gusty sigh came through the undergrowth,
and then a voice. &#8220;You from the 505th?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim kept his gun steady and answered, &#8220;Check.
Who&#8217;re you?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a soft groan. &#8220;Captain Dobie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim stared at the man pushing toward them,
then sprang forward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>&#8220;You hurt, sir?&#8221; He helped the officer to get to
his feet and took his arm. With Andr&eacute; on the other
side, they helped him stagger into the shadow of
a tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;We thought we&#8217;d lost you sure, Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; Slim
said sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Broke my leg when I landed on a stone wall,
I guess,&#8221; the officer said fretfully. He stared
around him and asked, &#8220;What&#8217;s happening? We
should start toward the coast&mdash;we&#8217;re much too
far in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim nodded. &#8220;I know. But Sergeant Weller&#8217;s
cleanin&#8217; out a machine-gun nest in the barn yonder.
He&#8217;ll be back with six or seven men shortly.
They must have finished over there by now. Some
Nazis was in this kid&#8217;s barn.&#8221; Slim directed a long
thumb at Andr&eacute;, and added, &#8220;He&#8217;s puny, but he&#8217;s
real sharp.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that he was evidently in great
pain, the captain managed to smile at the boy.</p>

<p>Slim had helped him to sit down, braced against
the tree. Andr&eacute; saw that he was watching&mdash;Slim,
Andr&eacute; himself, the road, the meadow. And he was
listening to the distant noises&mdash;for the return of
his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Should be nearly a hundred men in these
meadows right here,&#8221; the captain said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to get our parachuted equipment together. As
soon as you can, send someone for gear I saw drop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
near where I came down. One lot&#8217;s caught in a
tree&mdash;right across that open space. We need those
bazookas quick. German tanks are likely to be
coming along any minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This kid might be able to tell us somethin&#8217;
about the Nazis around these parts,&#8221; Slim said.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a Nazi camp half a mile down the
road,&#8221; Andr&eacute; replied eagerly. &#8220;And another big
one near Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise, if you know where that
is.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Captain Dobie nodded and turned his head to
catch the sound of a motor. &#8220;That car&#8217;s coming
this way fast!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was startled by the smooth swiftness with
which Slim and his captain acted then. Thrusting
his Tommy gun into the captain&#8217;s outstretched
hand without a word, Slim detached a grenade
from the cluster at his belt. He slipped into a
tense, waiting position closer to the road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>The captain ordered, &#8220;Down flat!&#8221; and Andr&eacute;
obeyed.</p>

<p>The roar of the approaching car grew loud.
Slim called softly, over his shoulder, &#8220;Nazi staff
car,&#8221; and raised his arm.</p>

<p>The explosion and the repeated crack of the
Tommy gun beside him shook the ground under
Andr&eacute;. As another grenade followed the first and
took effect, Captain Dobie said, &#8220;That&#8217;s one car
won&#8217;t stop the freeing of France.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim crossed the road and returned to report
solemnly, &#8220;Okay, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain nodded, then glanced quickly to
one side as a voice said, &#8220;Good work, Slim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Sergeant!&#8221; the captain exclaimed
in relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; Weller said. &#8220;We were worried
about you. What you got there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A broken leg, I think, worse luck,&#8221; Captain
Dobie explained angrily. &#8220;If you see a medic, send
him back here. But you men get going now. If we
don&#8217;t pick up that dropped ammunition and
equipment soon, we may be in for trouble. Meanwhile,
have you seen any place I can use for a command
post around here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can use my father&#8217;s house,&#8221; Andr&eacute; offered
eagerly. &#8220;My father, he&#8217;s a part of the Resistance,
so it&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain turned to Weller.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;Yes, sir. Solid stone, handy to the road, plenty
of room, barns. No bomb damage,&#8221; the sergeant
reported, and added, &#8220;Nobody but this kid home,
since we cleaned out the loft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; The captain looked sharply around at
the boy. &#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; explained quickly. &#8220;And my father and
Marie should have come back by now,&#8221; he finished.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. &#8220;Not from St.
Sauveur, they won&#8217;t. Not tonight. Our men must
have all the roads beyond Ste. M&egrave;re blocked off.&#8221;</p>

<p>While a couple of men watched the road, others
were sent to retrieve the dropped weapons. Sergeant
Weller examined the captain&#8217;s injury. He
found that a bone was cracked above the ankle.
A shot of morphine from a first-aid kit was given
Captain Dobie to ease the pain. Then splints were
found, and the leg bound with strips of torn parachute
silk.</p>

<p>Halfway through this, Weller paused suddenly
and said to Andr&eacute;, &#8220;By the way, son, you better
tie up that hound of yours. He doesn&#8217;t seem to
know Americans are his friends, by the way he lit
into my only pair of britches.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little party moved slowly toward the
Gagnon house, helping the half-crippled captain.</p>

<p>Pale moonlight glowed on the windows and
against dark walls. When Andr&eacute; saw the front<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
door ajar, he cried happily, &#8220;They must have
come home while I was asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Fraid not,&#8221; the sergeant corrected. &#8220;We went
through the whole house&mdash;Andr&eacute;. Want to know
how I got your name?&#8221; Weller grinned. &#8220;Read
Marie&#8217;s note about your supper on the kitchen
table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Immediately inside the house, the sergeant said
crisply, &#8220;This room okay, Captain? I guess it&#8217;s a
sort of store during peacetime. I&#8217;ll get you a table
and somethin&#8217; to sit on, pronto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had run to light candles and draw the
blackout curtains. Then he dragged his mother&#8217;s
best velvet chair from the parlor for Captain
Dobie, and brought cushions to prop up his leg.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie spread maps on the table before
him, but paused to study the boy.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked into his kind, thoughtful face and
asked, &#8220;Do you think my father and sister will be
all right, sir? It would be awful....&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain nodded. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;d let them start
out from St. Sauveur tonight, son. They&#8217;ll be all
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute;&#8217;s worry was not so easily talked away.
The thud of bombs and firing inland was too continuous.</p>

<p>He heard a whine and rushed into the kitchen
to a wet, pawing welcome from Patchou. He
tugged at the familiar warm fur and when Patchou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
had calmed down, brought him a bowl of milk.
Then, with a warning to be quiet, he chained the
dog to the fireplace grate.</p>

<p>At the front of the house he found that a
strange, businesslike disorder was mounting.</p>

<p>Just inside the door, bazookas, mortars, and
ammunition of all sorts were being pulled from
&#8220;drop&#8221; bundles. Bulky, helmeted soldiers were
coming in from everywhere, receiving quick
orders from the captain, and clanking off in
groups. Captain Dobie sent out a messenger for a
walkie-talkie, to make contact with his commanding
colonel.</p>

<p>At one moment, everyone around the captain
paused warily as the roar of a low-flying plane
shook the walls. Sergeant Weller and Andr&eacute;
darted out to the doorway and stared up at the
U. S. markings. As the plane sped by, a shower of
paper cascaded over the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of our Flying Fortresses dropping
leaflets, telling the Frenchies to scatter &#8217;n stay off
the roads.&#8221; Weller shrugged. &#8220;That means you,
too, boy, y&#8217;know.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the next thirty minutes Andr&eacute; sat and
watched while dirty, hot men clumped in and out
on errands that made no sense to him. Some had
been wounded. Many, hurt in the jump, were
being treated both by medics and some of the
village people. Slim pushed his way into the room,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
looking leaner and sootier than ever&mdash;all his
drowsiness gone.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; listened to his report. More troops were
needed at once toward the causeways. Glider
troops had landed, but the Germans were putting
up a fierce fight. The Americans wanted all the reinforcements
they could get rushed up fast.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie turned to Weller. &#8220;Okay, Sergeant,
take <i>all</i> these men. It&#8217;s our job to wipe out
those bridgeheads!&#8221; When Weller hesitated, he
snapped, &#8220;What&#8217;re you waiting for?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant blinked. &#8220;And leave you here
alone, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to get those bridgeheads. Move!&#8221;
Captain Dobie pounded the table. &#8220;Orders!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant Weller turned on his heel, shouted
commands to round up all the men, and left.</p>

<p>But just outside the door he jerked Slim aside.
&#8220;You stay,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;I&#8217;m not gonna leave the
cap&#8217;n here alone with a broken leg. What would
he do if some Nazis came along?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get me courtmartialed yet, Sarge,&#8221; Slim
objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t beat me to it. Stay out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant barked a command, and guns and
men moved away through the mud.</p>

<p>It was nearly full daylight now. When Andr&eacute;
turned back into the house he saw by the clock
that it was quarter to six.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>What would his family say if they knew he had
not been to bed at all? He wondered sleepily
whether to lie down quietly in a corner.</p>

<p>The captain was looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had taken a step toward him when the
house was shaken under a dreadful blast of sound.</p>

<p>The sound rose, and he realized it came from
the sea. Under the thud of heavy shelling and
bombing, objects on the walls and tables danced.</p>

<p>The captain looked up from his watch and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re right on time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Puzzled, Andr&eacute; asked, &#8220;Who is, monsieur?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the <i>real</i> Invasion, son, coming in now.
This is what General Eisenhower has been planning
for two years. Hundreds of thousands of men,
tens of thousands of tanks, bulldozers, and trucks
are moving in&mdash;<i>now</i>, in over four thousand ships.
The Navy&#8217;s shelling the coast. We just came in
ahead by parachute to get ready for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; found himself too excited to say anything.</p>

<p>The captain spoke again, above the din.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see why we have to clear the enemy out of
those bridgeheads? To let the men landing on the
beaches come through. As soon as the Navy finishes
this shelling, British, Canadian, and American
troops will be landing on sixty miles of beach
from here to the River Orne!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX<br />


<small><i>Victor&#8217;s Mission</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">R</span>EMEMBERING the rolling crashes of the
worst thunderstorm he had ever heard, Andr&eacute;
thought it had been nothing compared to this
noise.</p>

<p>He braced himself by the door frame and looked
toward the sea. A pall of dense, black smoke was
drifting inland, blotting out the newly risen sun.
Fires flared over the tree tops.</p>

<p>He saw Slim grinning back at him from behind
a thick lilac bush.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road, the Lescots&#8217; front
door opened. Victor, in nightcap and corduroy
pants drawn over a blue nightshirt, darted out,
picked up one of the dropped leaflets, and shot
back into the house.</p>

<p>From other houses people ran out and raced
away into the fields.</p>

<p>Bombers darted in and out of the curtain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
smoke. A barn less than a mile away broke into
flames.</p>

<p>Through a lull in the battle sounds Andr&eacute; heard
the outraged moo of a cow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor old beasts,&#8221; Andr&eacute; thought, &#8220;they must
be scared to death. I&#8217;ll go talk to them, and milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked again for Slim and saw that he had
turned his back to the fury of the coast and was
staring toward Ste. M&egrave;re. As Andr&eacute; stepped out
Slim whirled and shouted, &#8220;Tell the cap&#8217;n&mdash;two
Nazi tanks comin&#8217; this way!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Andr&eacute; had already heard the ominous clank
of the tanks. Even through the battle sounds their
threat rang out&mdash;a new danger.</p>

<p>As Slim raced toward him, Andr&eacute; broke into a
run for the house, shouting, &#8220;TANKS, mon Capitaine.
Nazi tanks coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie had risen and stumbled a step
toward the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blast it!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Help me, Cimino.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; then saw a new man in the room&mdash;a
soldier with a walkie-talkie, who must have arrived
by way of the farmyard.</p>

<p>Slim plunged through the door and snatched up
a bazooka from the pile of arms in the hall.
Cimino, the walkie-talkie operator, slipped out of
the straps holding the instrument. He flung himself
toward Slim to serve as second man on the
bazooka.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>&#8220;Help me to the window, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; Captain
Dobie ordered, picking up a Tommy gun. &#8220;Then
stay out of range.</p>

<p>&#8220;Slim,&#8221; he barked, &#8220;fire at the front drive
sprocket and the gas tanks, center, low. You can&#8217;t
penetrate that forward armor, remember.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_058.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The bazooka muzzle thrust out the window,
Slim knelt in tense firing position. Cimino stood
ready to reload.</p>

<p>The captain braced himself at the second window,
Tommy gun leveled. Andr&eacute; heard the rumble
of the tanks draw nearer.</p>

<p>The explosion of fire from the windows and
the fierce back-flash of the bazooka joined with
the grinding screech of shattered metal, outside.
Then came the hollow scraping of steel on steel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Over Slim&#8217;s head Andr&eacute; had seen the first tank&#8217;s
turret. Then the second tank tottered over the
first. And like a huge apple peel, a tremendous
snakelike steel tread whipped through the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; snapped Captain Dobie. &#8220;Second one&#8217;s
piled up on the first. Shoot overhead, once.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the firing from the house stopped, there
came a shout of &#8220;<i>Kamerad!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain poked his weapon farther out the
window and shouted, &#8220;Get out and put your hands
up fast. You&#8217;re all covered. Okay, Slim, get your
prisoners.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>Cimino stacked the bazooka against the sill, and
whipped out his .45 automatic. Slim swept up a
carbine and strode outside.</p>

<p>The crews were already out of the tanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Hands on your heads!&#8221; Slim shouted.</p>

<p>As his captives moved toward him, Cimino lifted
their side arms from holsters, pushing the prisoners
swiftly toward the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in there, quick,&#8221; Slim commanded.</p>

<p>He had only just herded them into the hall
when his voice was drowned out by the explosion
of the gas tanks in one of the wrecked vehicles.</p>

<p>The captain and Andr&eacute; ducked as ammunition,
set off by the flames, sprayed the outside of the
house.</p>

<p>When it was over, the captain leaned out the
window, and Andr&eacute; asked, &#8220;Did it wreck my father&#8217;s
pump?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just knocked down the sign that said &#8216;<i>Chocolate</i>,&#8217;&#8221;
the captain said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; Andr&eacute; laughed shakily. &#8220;We
did not have any left to sell, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie wiped the sweat from his face,
and with Andr&eacute;&#8217;s help, hobbled back to his easy
chair and cushions.</p>

<p>The Germans, lined up against the wall, stared
at him silently, open-mouthed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any more tanks coming this way?&#8221;
demanded the captain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>One of the Nazis, with sergeant&#8217;s stripes, said,
&#8220;<i>Nein</i>&mdash;no more,&#8221; with surly shortness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be respectful,&#8221; snapped the captain coldly. He
turned to Slim. &#8220;Take them out to the yard and
stand guard, Slim,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Cimino, try to raise
someone on the talkie. If you can&#8217;t, get a runner
to locate the colonel and tell him where <i>we</i> are.&#8221;</p>

<p>After several minutes, Cimino reported, &#8220;Some
sergeant thinks our colonel&#8217;s over near the first
bridgehead. He&#8217;ll pass the word along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;, at the captain&#8217;s suggestion, went out to
survey the road and report any sight of the enemy.
&#8220;Here, take my helmet,&#8221; offered the captain.
&#8220;There&#8217;s too much stuff falling out of the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>The thud of heavy explosions beyond the village
continued to rock the earth.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had been on watch but a few minutes
when he sighted a car. He called back through the
window, &#8220;Jeep coming, sir&mdash;from the coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim, who had been relieved of his guard duty
by Cimino, rushed out to join Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>The little car swung in toward the two, and
braked with a screech. Slim shouted, &#8220;Weller!
Where&#8217;ja get that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant Weller was eyeing the wrecked German
tanks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Texas,&#8221; he smiled approvingly, &#8220;good
thing I left you here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slid out of the seat. &#8220;Lucky those two tanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
didn&#8217;t get through to hit us from behind,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve sure had our hands full down there. The
Heinies came at us from all sides. But, for some
reason, one of the causeways across the swamps was
unguarded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got some prisoners for you, out back,&#8221;
Slim announced. &#8220;And you better report to the
cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he added. &#8220;He&#8217;s restless as a hungry
puppy. Ain&#8217;t had a word from anybody higher up.
Didn&#8217;t come across our colonel, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I came back for,&#8221; said Weller.
&#8220;Saw him and told him about this command post.
He&#8217;s feelin&#8217; good. We&#8217;ve taken two bridgeheads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>where</i> did you get the jeep?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>Weller patted the mud-splattered windshield.
&#8220;I &#8216;liberated&#8217; her from a smashed glider, son.&#8221; He
turned a thumb to the heaps of K-rations packed
in the rear of the jeep. &#8220;Near time we ate,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But, right now, I&#8217;m in need of gas, kid. I bet
you got some in that pump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said.</p>

<p>Slim and Weller clanked off to the house while
Andr&eacute; connected the hose to the jeep tank and
began to pump. His eyelids were drooping.</p>

<p>It takes a long time for this Invasion to get
going, he thought. He had already grown used to
the <i>thrump</i> of big artillery, the bark of machine
and rifle fire scattered across all of Normandy. He
had heard Cimino say that the 82nd Airborne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
were getting on well around Ste. M&egrave;re, though the
Germans were fighting bitterly. The Liberation
was too big. Andr&eacute; could think of it no more.</p>

<p>And through his weariness he heard the cows
again. Milking time was long past. In the barn the
cows turned their sad eyes on him accusingly. He
rested his forehead on their soft, warm bodies
while he milked, and both he and the frightened
beasts were soothed. He saw to it that they had
fresh hay and water. The open pasture was no
place for them today.</p>

<p>Finally the job was done; the last of his strength
was gone. He put the pails of milk to one side and
sank into a pile of fresh straw.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them to the springhouse in a minute,&#8221;
he promised himself. And he wriggled flat
in the fragrant hay and spread out his arms peacefully.</p>

<p>All battle sounds were muffled by the thick old
stone walls. The familiar rustle and stamping of
cattle were like a familiar song....</p>

<p>He woke with a hand shaking his shoulder.</p>

<p>Someone was saying, in French, &#8220;Wake up,
Andr&eacute;. Wake up! The <i>Invasion</i> has started.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; opened his eyes and saw Victor Lescot
bent over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on you, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; he scolded. &#8220;Milk getting
sour. War going on all around, and you sleeping.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>Andr&eacute; sat up. &#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to be shut up
in your house, Victor. What are you doing here?&#8221;
he said crossly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stay home now,&#8221; Victor bristled. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got to go get my new cart&mdash;before it is destroyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now wide awake, Andr&eacute; said with disgust, &#8220;You
can&#8217;t go out into the fighting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I <i>must</i>,&#8221; Victor interrupted shrilly. &#8220;My
new cart will be blown to bits if I leave it at
Jacquard&#8217;s. Then what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; could not believe his ears. &#8220;Would you
rather be blown to bits yourself?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we do not need to thrust ourselves into
danger,&#8221; Victor protested. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make our way
to Jacquard&#8217;s village by the cowpaths, you and I.
We know them well, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>WE?</i>&#8221; Andr&eacute; echoed. &#8220;<i>Who&#8217;s</i> going with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, naturally, my little friend, I may need
you to speak English.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is the cart?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Jacquard&#8217;s workshop, on his farm. I have
told you about it on numerous occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; smiled. &#8220;Victor Lescot, Jacquard&#8217;s shop
is right near the coast, where the fighting is. Who
knows, there may be a battle going on in Jacquard&#8217;s
own courtyard right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor&#8217;s eyes flickered. &#8220;Ah, but I have a plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no sense to it.&#8221; Andr&eacute; shrugged and
got to his feet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;No sense!&#8221; Victor cried, as though he were
about to hurl a bolt of lightning. &#8220;You forget. The
cart is <i>mine</i>. <i>I paid for it</i> yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Andr&eacute; could only shake his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll put this milk where it is cool,&#8221; he said, and
started off with a pail in each hand.</p>

<p>Victor dived for the other pail and followed.
&#8220;La Fum&eacute;e, my mare that you have always been
so fond of, you know,&#8221; he chattered, &#8220;she&#8217;s all
harnessed and impatient to start off. You know
how she loves adventure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there was a definite lull in the shelling.
Andr&eacute; set the pails into the cool, stone-lined
spring, taking Victor&#8217;s from him.</p>

<p>Victor caught his eye. &#8220;The noise is not so
loud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There is a trifling din, true, but it
is less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the worst is over,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said. &#8220;We
could just start out, and if they tell us we can&#8217;t
proceed, we can turn back....&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor&#8217;s pink face crinkled brightly. &#8220;But of
course. Anything else would be gross stupidity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; fretted: Now he thinks I&#8217;ve promised to
get his cart no matter what happens.</p>

<p>But the Americans would turn them back at
once&mdash;so no harm would be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, Victor. I will start out,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SEVEN<br />


<small><i>Tricolor over Ste. M&egrave;re</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>NDR&Eacute; hesitated. &#8220;You wait for me at your
house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;First, I have one thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor stole a searching glance at the boy, then,
almost reassured, he nodded and left the springhouse
at once.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; filled a pitcher with milk and started for
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>Ranged along the barnyard wall lounged half a
hundred German prisoners surrounded by a semicircle
of muddy guards bristling with carbines and
Tommy guns.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; found a mug in the kitchen, and carried
the milk in to Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>He noticed that the officer&#8217;s leg was badly
swollen, but the captain seemed unaware of it.</p>

<p>The room was crammed with soldiers. Several
neighbors, men and women, pressed through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
crowd, begging to give help. Many wounded villagers
lay sheltered under the trees, they said. But
they and the small neighborhood children were
being cared for and fed. The captain welcomed
them and advised the elders to get deep cellars
ready. They must keep the children close to them
in case the fighting broke out in the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Germans are fighting hard everywhere,
and we must silence each Nazi gun no matter
where we find it,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Until we get a
solid foothold here, we cannot help liberate your
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; listened, and when he caught the captain&#8217;s
eye, offered his jug of milk. With a grateful
smile, Dobie drained the jug thirstily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are things going all right, sir?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>The captain seemed reluctant to reply. But
after a moment he said, &#8220;The landings are the
hardest, son. The Nazis made the coast tough with
their underwater obstructions, and the sea has
been a lot rougher than we&#8217;d planned on. But it&#8217;s
going along well. You ought to be seeing heavy
equipment coming along the roads soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant Weller clumped in with two soldiers
and a battle-weary young Frenchman. &#8220;Look,
kid,&#8221; Weller shouted to Andr&eacute;. &#8220;D&#8217;you know who
this character is? I can&#8217;t make head or tail what
he&#8217;s sayin&#8217;. <i>He</i> says he&#8217;s speakin&#8217; English, but, boy,
it&#8217;s nothin&#8217; I ever heard in Brooklyn.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>The young Frenchman called to Andr&eacute; in
French, &#8220;You are Pierre&#8217;s son, no? Tell them
quickly who I am. Make them see my urgency, I
beg you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked at the man&#8217;s flashing eyes, the
beaked nose, the shock of dark hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know him,&#8221; he said quickly. &#8220;This is
Fran&ccedil;ois, the famous Maquis leader. You can
trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure?&#8221; Weller demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said. &#8220;I have seen him and
heard my father describe him often. One moment&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>In French, Fran&ccedil;ois told Andr&eacute; his story: &#8220;I
was coming to your father to get more Resistance
help. My band is too small. We discovered Nazis
coming up behind your father&#8217;s orchard with a
mobile gun. They are going to blow up this house
because it is an American headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Translate so far,&#8221; Weller said, and Andr&eacute;
obeyed.</p>

<p>Weller scowled. &#8220;Yeh? Well, in that case....&#8221;</p>

<p>He made his way to the captain, and a moment
later Andr&eacute; heard him shouting orders.</p>

<p>When Weller returned he put out both hands
and the Frenchman shook them warmly.</p>

<p>The squad Weller was forming was hastily
gathering up grenades, bazookas, and other equipment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Andr&eacute; asked the Maquis anxiously, &#8220;Can you
tell me anything about St. Sauveur? How is the
battle going beyond Ste. M&egrave;re?&#8221;</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois looked solemn, but answered quickly.
&#8220;St. Sauveur, we think, is still mostly outside the
fighting. Not all of Ste. M&egrave;re has been cleared of
Germans yet. But the center of the town is under
control. At least, the Americans have the French
flag flying from Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise&#8217;s town hall. None
of the Allied tanks have come through yet and
they are badly needed. Also, in some places the
Americans are running short of ammunition. And
the Nazis are building up their forces near the
bridges over the Merderet River, west of Ste.
M&egrave;re.&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off at Weller&#8217;s signal, and with the
sergeant&#8217;s squad slipped out through the barnyard.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The French flag flying from Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise&#8217;s
town hall!</i>&#8221; Andr&eacute; repeated it aloud. And a
familiar voice at the doorway echoed the great
words.</p>

<p>Raoul Cotein stood just outside the door. His
arm and forehead were bandaged, and in his hand
was a package wrapped in a napkin.</p>

<p>He took a step forward. &#8220;My wife&mdash;well, she
is troubled because your mother and sister are not
here. If you will just accept these few sandwiches?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The squad gathered up grenades, bazookas,
and other equipment</i></p>

<p>Andr&eacute; took the packet with a puzzled &#8220;Thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
you,&#8221; and stared at his suddenly subdued neighbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;W-what happened to you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Raoul looked down at his arm bandage. &#8220;You
mean this?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;<i>Tiens</i>, Andr&eacute;. Do you
know, I found I was almost the only man in this
village who was not of the Resistance? I have
merely been remedying the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know now my father is a Maquis and
not a collaborationist?&#8221; Andr&eacute; demanded, and
Raoul nodded. &#8220;I have discovered so. I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>If he had meant to apologize further for his past
bad behavior, his words were lost. A shell overshot
the house and everyone ran for cover.</p>

<p>When Andr&eacute; slid out from his hiding place,
Raoul was gone.</p>

<p>For a moment the boy stood alone. &#8220;Well, now,
what is my duty?&#8221; he considered. &#8220;Victor? No....
Patchou.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went to the kitchen, gave the dog food and
water, and hastily ate Raoul&#8217;s sandwiches. Meanwhile
Patchou gamboled for a few minutes around
the room.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; thought that he had better go to Lescots&#8217;
and tell the old man, once and for all, how foolish
his plan was. Even Victor would see that now.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Victor stood near his barnyard gates crossly
watching the distant scene.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>A broad, fawn-colored Percheron stood harnessed
beside Victor. A shotgun was strapped to
the horse&#8217;s back-pad alongside the looped-up
traces.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; slipped over the wall and whistled.</p>

<p>At the sound, Victor jumped, steadied his
glasses, and chattered, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you at last. La
Fum&eacute;e is beside herself with impatience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; interrupted firmly. &#8220;I came only to tell
you the thought of going toward the coast is an
insanity. The fighting has grown intense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor fanned out his hands. &#8220;Then my cart
... you think it is a trifle to be ignored....&#8221;
His eyes snapped. &#8220;Which <i>I have paid for</i>, please
recall!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Victor&mdash;&#8221; Andr&eacute; sighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;From infancy I have indulged you, because of
my love....&#8221; Victor chided gently.</p>

<p>He patted the mare&#8217;s smooth flank and climbed
up on her back. &#8220;There will be many Americans
down there, I presume. No doubt they will help an
old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Victor, you know I can&#8217;t let you go alone,&#8221;
Andr&eacute; exploded. &#8220;Pull me up behind you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later, Andr&eacute;, clinging to Victor&#8217;s
ribs, was mounted and jogging around a
corner of the farm wall.</p>

<small><i>Prisoners</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>S A very small boy, riding on the broad platform
of La Fum&eacute;e&#8217;s back had been Andr&eacute;&#8217;s delight.
But La Fum&eacute;e had not then quivered at the
whine and roar of shells, or the nerve-shaking rattle
of machine guns. And the fields had not been
spiked with wicked barbed-wire glider traps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, we zigzag,&#8221; explained Victor as he
turned the mare into a hedge-lined path at the
next field. It was necessary to round barns and
ponds and areas marked in German: &#8220;<i>Achtung&mdash;Minen!</i>&#8221;
&#8220;Beware&mdash;Mines!&#8221; to avoid even the
smaller country roads.</p>

<p>They covered nearly a mile at the Percheron&#8217;s
steady plod. Then a shell crashed a hundred yards
away, and the horse cowered under a shower of
falling debris. Victor and Andr&eacute; had flattened
themselves on the Percheron&#8217;s vast back. With his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
head still buried in Victor&#8217;s rough coat, Andr&eacute;
begged, &#8220;Surely it is wiser to turn back, Victor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man sighed. &#8220;But it is now such a little
way. It is a pity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both sat up cautiously.</p>

<p>The marshes glowed beyond a broken orchard,
just across the Paris-Cherbourg road. Far to the
northeast, from a German pillbox sunk beside the
flooded land, swiveled guns thumped, and were
immediately answered by other, unseen guns.</p>

<p>Before they could move again, Andr&eacute; cried,
&#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_074.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A tremendous explosion, close to the sea, was
followed by a shattering series of rolling reverberations.
And immediately, from almost on the horizon,
a fleet of planes swept upward sharply over
their heads.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Dive bombers,&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried. &#8220;They must be
finishing off those big German guns on the sea
bluff.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, added to the shock and noise of the
bombing, rose all around them a fury of gobbling
protest. Turkeys which had been roosting in the
trees screamed and fluttered insanely. In the grass,
a family of small white pigs ran helter-skelter toward
the hedges.</p>

<p>La Fum&eacute;e stood stiff, with rolling eyes.</p>

<p>At length the last wave of bombers passed. The
air over the orchard reeked, and smoke seeped inland
from the marshes.</p>

<p>The turkeys continued to scold, their voices
dropping to an angry gurgle.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, that is over,&#8221; Victor said firmly. &#8220;Jacquard&#8217;s
is so close, we may as well go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>La Fum&eacute;e moved woodenly, and Andr&eacute;
smoothed her thick, firm flank with a gentle hand.</p>

<p>If they were to go on, they must cross the wide,
pitted Paris-Cherbourg road. And into this angled
a smaller one. This led to Jacquard&#8217;s, and
continued seaward to the hamlet of l&#8217;Audouville.</p>

<p>The road stretching north and south was completely
deserted just then except for a litter of
wrecked Nazi trucks pushed to the sides.</p>

<p>La Fum&eacute;e put on a jiggling burst of speed to
cross the main road. The smaller road also seemed
empty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;You see,&#8221; Victor said. &#8220;Here we are. Jacquard&#8217;s
place is just ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s sharper eyes studied the high stone
walls and the slate roofs above. &#8220;It has been
bombed or shelled already,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Victor hunched forward, shocked into silence.</p>

<p>The farm&#8217;s roadside gates sagged open on broken
hinges, and fowl wandered in and out.</p>

<p>The sound of a car racing up the main road to
Cherbourg caught Andr&eacute;&#8217;s ear. As he turned, he
saw the car hesitate at the fork of their road, and
then swing into it at gathering speed.</p>

<p>He thrust his hand under Victor&#8217;s arm, grabbed
the reins, and yanked the Percheron into the shallow
ditch at the side.</p>

<p>The car swept past so fast, Andr&eacute; caught only a
glimpse of the Nazi Swastika on the side.</p>

<p>Nearing the broken gate, the Nazi driver slowed
uncertainly. But instantly he swung into a teetering
turn, and shot into the barnyard in the midst
of an uproar of cackling hens and geese.</p>

<p>There was a muffled crash.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; and Victor slid quickly from La Fum&eacute;e&#8217;s
back with thumping hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are trapped,&#8221; Andr&eacute; whispered, &#8220;and do
not know how to get out. We must bring some
soldiers before they come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor was loosening his shotgun with trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
hands. But his experience with farmyards
now served him well.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, those Nazi officers have run
spank into the manure pile,&#8221; he stated with satisfaction.
&#8220;They will find some troublesomeness getting
loose.&#8221; He took a step forward. &#8220;You must
run quickly for help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; thought, &#8220;The first of the soldiers from
the landing barges must surely be coming across
the causeways by now. Captain Dobie said they
would.&#8221;</p>

<p>Skittering along past the gate into the grassy
edge of the road, he began to run toward l&#8217;Audouville
as fast as his legs would carry him.</p>

<p>Racing against time, Andr&eacute; could not look back.
Before he reached the turn his heart leaped.</p>

<p>A soldier, bulky with equipment, was coming
toward him. He was moving cautiously along the
roadside, rifle poised. And fanning out behind him
was a spaced line of Americans.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; dashed toward them.</p>

<p>Unsmiling and with leveled gun, the first soldier
yelled, &#8220;Halt!&#8221; He then said rapidly in
French, &#8220;Who are you? And <i>where&#8217;re</i> you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; pointed back to the Jacquard farm.
&#8220;Nazi officers back there. Come get them quick&mdash;please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Beckoning, he turned to run.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Just a minute there,&#8221; the soldier shouted.
&#8220;Come back here, <i>petit gar&ccedil;on</i>. What&#8217;s this you&#8217;re
talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was terrified by the wasted minutes.</p>

<p>He shouted, &#8220;<i>Come!</i> A car full of Nazi officers
just drove into a farmyard back there. <i>Hurry!</i> You
can take them, but <i>hurry</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The scattered scouting party began to move
ahead warily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a chance the kid is okay,&#8221; the sergeant
called back. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to take a look. Keep your
eyes open&mdash;and keep separated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant quickened his pace, but cautioned,
&#8220;Take it easy, kid. Let us get &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before they reached the Jacquard gate, sheltered
by bushes, Andr&eacute; fell to his knees and crept
toward it.</p>

<p>He had not quite reached it when two quick
shotgun blasts rang out.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Victor&#8217;s gun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Nazis must
have started to leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shot rattled on metal, and the tail of the Nazi
car smashed through the gates. But, halfway
through, the car teetered sharply into the stone
post. Rocking, it toppled over and skidded to a
stop.</p>

<p>A voice shouted toward the car, &#8220;Hold it. Get
out and keep your hands up!&#8221; A Tommy gun chattered
across the car&#8217;s spinning wheels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Scrambling boots pounded into action. The
German officers were jerked up and out through
the door. Andr&eacute; was startled to see a colonel&#8217;s
insignia on one officer&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>When the Nazis were all on their feet, the sergeant&#8217;s
men surrounded them. Two soldiers relieved
the officers of their side arms.</p>

<p>As the shock of their capture wore off, the Nazis
began to protest curtly, and the sergeant retorted
in their own language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay. You&#8217;re staff officers! We&#8217;ll get you to the
proper authorities just as soon as we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had seen plenty of Germans, but few of
such high rank.</p>

<p>Suddenly it dawned on him that it was Victor&#8217;s
shots which had made the capture possible by
wrecking the car. But where was Victor?</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; ran around the farm buildings, but
neither Victor nor La Fum&eacute;e was in sight&mdash;anywhere.</p>

<p>Shells had blasted the carpentry shop, and rubbish
lay over the scattered, twisted, and blackened
tools.</p>

<p>After a thorough search, Andr&eacute; stumbled sadly
out to the courtyard and around the scattered
manure pile, toward the group at the gate.</p>

<p>He was greeted by a shout from a jeep which
had driven up. &#8220;Hi, there. You&mdash;boy!&#8221;</p>

<p>An American lieutenant sat at the wheel, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
the two Nazi officers crammed rigidly in the rear
seat. An American with a Tommy gun perched
backward on each of the front mudguards, and
the German driver, his arm in a sling, shared the
front seat with the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Impatiently, the lieutenant asked Andr&eacute;
whether he knew where the nearest U. S. headquarters
had been set up.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Andr&eacute; pointed up the road and replied, with
some pride, that there was an 82nd Command
Post in his own house. &#8220;It&#8217;s a little more than a
mile up that way,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The lieutenant grinned. &#8220;Well, hop in and
show us the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood stubbornly firm. &#8220;But Lieutenant,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
he protested, &#8220;I came with Victor. He&#8217;s an
old man. I can&#8217;t leave him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Get in</i>,&#8221; snapped the lieutenant. &#8220;You can
find him later. There&#8217;s a war on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As if I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; Andr&eacute; thought crossly.</p>

<p>But he climbed over the great booted legs of
the guard, and hunched in under the elbow of the
German prisoner.</p>

<p>The jeep lurched into gear and roared down
the road.</p>

<small><i>Victor Disappears</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>S THE jeep bumped rapidly along, Andr&eacute;
explained to the lieutenant, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to
leave there, sir, till I found my friend Victor. He
was the one who really stopped that Nazi car,
shooting at the tires, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did?&#8221; the lieutenant exclaimed. &#8220;Well,
why did he disappear after we got there?&#8221;</p>

<p>One of the guards interrupted. &#8220;Old Frenchman?
Walrus mustache? With a shotgun?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; nodded excitedly. &#8220;Did you see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Saw a man like that run back into the orchard
of that farm just as we came up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; said no more; at least Victor could run.</p>

<p>The jeep had been proceeding cautiously
around road blocks and paratroopers. Now it
speeded up.</p>

<p>A little while later, Andr&eacute; saw the roofs of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
own village, and he cried, &#8220;Oh! it&#8217;s been hit!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a different village than the one Andr&eacute;
had left. Many shells must have struck it. Trees
were shattered and old walls tumbled. Two
houses, not far from the Gagnons&#8217;, were badly
damaged&mdash;one lay in smoking ruins.</p>

<p>People of the neighborhood shuffled to and fro
with arms filled with possessions.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; called to one of them, &#8220;The Cotys and
Mme. Lescot&mdash;are they all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Everyone did what your captain told us
to. We ran into the fields and hid in ditches when
those German shells started coming. It was not for
long. We are told the Maquis found the Nazi gun
and blew it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>At a sign from Andr&eacute;, the jeep slowed and, a
moment later, he saw that his father&#8217;s house still
stood.</p>

<p>In the doorway, Sergeant Weller shouted at
sight of the jeep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kid, you had us scared. Where the&mdash;where
you been?&#8221; he demanded tartly of Andr&eacute;. But he
did not wait for an answer.</p>

<p>He gave the jeep and its load a hasty glance, and
cried, &#8220;<i>You</i> bringin&#8217; in prisoners, too!&#8221; Then,
noticing their rank, he added to the lieutenant, in
his sharp, official bark, &#8220;Bring that German
&#8216;brass&#8217; right in here, sir. Our company colonel&#8217;s
inside. He&#8217;ll sure want to question &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Inside the house Andr&eacute; found a new, older
American officer busy with maps beside Captain
Dobie.</p>

<p>They received the prisoners coolly.</p>

<p>After questioning the Nazi officers a few moments,
Captain Dobie hobbled out to the hallway
and closed the door after him. His broken leg wore
fresh splints and a new dressing.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_084.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The captain looked at Andr&eacute; with displeasure.
&#8220;I should keep a closer eye on you, boy,&#8221; he said
sharply. &#8220;What do you mean by running loose
around the country with a war going on?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the captain could continue, Slim sidled
through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but that lieutenant
an&#8217; the guards are sittin&#8217; out there in the jeep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
D&#8217;ya want &#8217;em to wait, or can they go, the lieutenant
says?&#8221;</p>

<p>A call from the colonel in the other room, summoning
Captain Dobie, interrupted him.</p>

<p>When Dobie returned with the colonel, the
Nazis, well covered by guns, were ceremoniously
marched back to the jeep.</p>

<p>The American officer&#8217;s orders were curt. &#8220;Lieutenant,
I want these men delivered to the general,
by you, personally. He&#8217;s somewhere on Utah
Beach by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jeep, loaded like a school bus, turned and
disappeared in the direction from which it had
just come.</p>

<small>&#8220;<i>Here Come the Tanks!</i>&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">L</span>ONG before dark, Andr&eacute;, too tired to care any
more what happened, had stumbled into his old
bed in the kitchen. During the night he roused at
times to hear the hum of trucks and clumping
feet. He did not hear the squadrons of planes coming
in to drop relief troops and much-needed ammunition
to the hard-pressed &#8217;chutists.</p>

<p>At dawn he awoke completely fresh, and went
to look at his now unfamiliar Normandy landscape.</p>

<p>Women tramped to damaged houses, distributing
hot food and blankets. Two small boys were
investigating a badly smashed glider which had
settled on a hedge.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had just decided to run to the Lescot
farm, to inquire whether Victor had come home,
when Weller called to him to come to breakfast.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>Afterwards, he went about his usual farm
chores.</p>

<p>Troops from the beach landings filtered
through the village that day. Their officers paused
briefly at the Gagnon house to exchange reports
with Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, at any rate, our tanks are beginning to
come across the causeways now,&#8221; a newly arrived
major told the captain. &#8220;That&#8217;ll help the airborne
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a great relief,&#8221; Captain Dobie said.
&#8220;Our parachute fellows have been fighting hard
without any rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The major nodded. &#8220;The only trouble is,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;somebody overlooked the way these thick
French hedgerows stop our tanks cold. We&#8217;ve got
to find a way to cut through them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; listened with amazement. He had never
thought of those ancient borders to the tiny Normandy
meadows as tank traps. He knew, of course,
that cattle turned out to pasture seldom broke
through the high, earth banks topped by the century-old
tangles. It did seem disappointing to
think that those great, wonderful American war
machines could be stopped by shrubbery.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why don&#8217;t the tanks keep to the roads, sir?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>The major grinned. &#8220;If Normandy had ten
times as many roads, son,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
wouldn&#8217;t have enough for all the stuff the Allies
have to move into France. Besides, our tanks have
to go where we know the Germans are massing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The major was right about over-busy highways.</p>

<p>Trucks, loaded with armed men and supplies,
had begun to grind by in a long, noisy procession.
Some village people had come back from hiding.
Children big and little ran along the roadside,
catching windfalls of candy, gum, and cellophane-wrapped
cookies tossed out by the soldiers.</p>

<p>To Andr&eacute; this was a very, very strange war&mdash;he
could remember nothing like it in any history
book.</p>

<p>But when he went into the kitchen, he no
longer felt that his father&#8217;s house was threatened
from all sides.</p>

<p>The crowd of German prisoners had been
moved to a new compound, and the geese had
once more taken possession of the pond. Andr&eacute;
counted the chickens. The flock looked a little
sparse.</p>

<p>A shout from Sergeant Weller sent Andr&eacute; back
to the road.</p>

<p>Inside the front window Captain Dobie and
Slim stood, waving cheerily. Weller, both arms upraised,
was saluting the approach of a great elephant
of a machine. It came lumbering up the sea
road, its wide, corrugated treads clanking on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
gravel. After the first, in stately dignity, thundered
more of the metallic herd.</p>

<p>&#8220;The TANKS! The tanks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s heart thumped with excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some sight, eh, boy?&#8221; Weller shouted.</p>

<p>With Weller, Andr&eacute; ran out to reach up and
shake hands with the tank men.</p>

<p>The tank commanders and the gunners, Andr&eacute;
thought, were even wilder-looking creatures than
the &#8217;chutists.</p>

<p>The men seemed colossal, standing in their turrets
before the radio antennae that wavered nervously,
like an insect&#8217;s feelers, with the sway of the
tanks. Pushed-up goggles over helmets, and earphones,
made drivers and gunners seem part of
the weird contraptions.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are wonderful,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said. &#8220;I wish I
could have seen them come ashore from the ships
that brought them across the Channel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant Weller frowned. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d
have liked it, son. Only a few hours ago these men
came off landin&#8217; craft that were bein&#8217; shot at by
Nazis from every direction. These guys are just
the lucky ones that didn&#8217;t get hit.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gathered villagers cheered, and the sound
of their welcome rang out far up the road.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was still looking for Victor. But Victor
had not been seen that day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>Andr&eacute; sauntered over to where the colonel had
joined Dobie and the others in the window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; Andr&eacute; began. &#8220;Sir, about Victor&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; smiled the captain. &#8220;You wonder why
he doesn&#8217;t come back. I feel sure he&#8217;ll be all right.
If that car full of Nazi officers got through the
roads from Paris to here, then I&#8217;m sure your
friend Victor can find his way around. The Nazi
officers said they drove straight through Caen,
Carentan, and right through our lines, if you
please&mdash;British <i>and</i> American. They actually got
as far as the Jacquard farm without being detected.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel spoke up. &#8220;As a matter of fact, I
don&#8217;t think the German staff in Paris knew how
much country our airborne troops were covering.
How could they? We had jammed their coastal
radio and radar stations all the way to Cherbourg.
And the French Resistance and our men cut telephone
land lines. So it was impossible for the
commanding German general here on the peninsula
to communicate with Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those Nazi prisoners,&#8221; said Dobie, &#8220;told us
they came up from Paris to find out what was
really happening here. Hitler believed that our
invasion was coming at Calais.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He sure missed the boat,&#8221; Weller said cheerfully.</p>

<p>The last of the squadron of tanks had gone by,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
and the village people were returning to their
homes. Andr&eacute; went back to the farmyard. It was
time for chores. He heard laughter coming from
the barns, but by now he was used to soldier
sounds.</p>

<p>First, he must see how badly the orchard and
fields in the rear had been hit by the shelling. He
went through the gate in the courtyard wall.</p>

<p>His jaw dropped. Many apple trees were down.
Great smudged shell holes gaped between them.
And the greatest hole yawned only a few feet away
from the edge of the lane where his trumpet was
buried.</p>

<p>He snatched up a shovel, and sighed in relief
when the trumpet came up, green and smeared
with damp earth, but unharmed. He nestled it
comfortably under his arm and went to the barn
door.</p>

<p>The cows had not lowed, and now he saw why.
Balanced on stools beside the animals sat two
lusty Americans. They were happily squirting
streams into milk pails held correctly between
their knees.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers looked up curiously.</p>

<p>At the sight of the horn under Andr&eacute;&#8217;s arm he
cried, &#8220;Well, if it isn&#8217;t Little Boy Blue, horn and
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second milker called, &#8220;These cows yours?
We thought nobody was home. Sure seems good to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
milk an ole bossy again.&#8221; He grinned. &#8220;I come
from Iowa an&#8217; I sure miss milkin&#8217; time. Hope you
don&#8217;t mind. We&#8217;re almost through here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The men paused to admire Andr&eacute;&#8217;s trumpet,
and tootle a few wild notes, before they helped
him carry the pails to the springhouse. He filled
a pitcher for Captain Dobie, and took it to the
&#8220;staff room,&#8221; as the old store was now called. The
room was again filled with strange soldiers, some
of them in bloody bandages.</p>

<p>The colonel was anxious to get away to his division
command post.</p>

<p>&#8220;You stay right here, Dobie,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the
sergeant and Slim as well. And hustle medics and
replacement infantry forward, fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim appeared and announced that he had
Weller&#8217;s jeep ready to drive the colonel to his
headquarters.</p>

<p>When Captain Dobie and Andr&eacute; were alone,
the captain smiled and sighed. &#8220;A fine mother I
turned out to be,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<i>When</i> did you eat
something last?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; grinned shyly. &#8220;When did <i>you</i> eat last,
sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergeant Weller&#8217;s voice roared from the hallway,
&#8220;Lunch coming up!&#8221;</p>

<p>A large loaded tray appeared through the door,
followed by Weller&#8217;s bulky body.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>Andr&eacute; looked at a heaped platter in the middle,
and laughed. &#8220;So that is where our chickens
went.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father will be paid for these fowl,&#8221;
Dobie said. &#8220;So make up for the eating you haven&#8217;t
done today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller was not as good a cook as his mother or
Marie, Andr&eacute; thought. But he was surprised that
a tough sergeant could cook at all, and the meal
was good.</p>

<p>When the sun sank red behind the trees, an
evening hush settled, although soldiers from nearby
bivouacs moved through the village restlessly.</p>

<p>Weller yawned. &#8220;I hope it stays quiet around
here awhile,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After last night we could
do with a little snooze, eh, Captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had scarcely made this wish than Andr&eacute;
cried, &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>A distant sound of motors from the sky was
drowned by the opening bark of an American
antiaircraft battery close by.</p>

<p>Weller leaped to put out the lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;Might have known the Luftwaffe would wake
up about now,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie&#8217;s voice came out of the darkness.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wondering why we haven&#8217;t heard from
them these last two days. Our air boys must have
pretty thoroughly crippled them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Ears were strained to follow the sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be several planes,&#8221; Dobie said. &#8220;They
seem to be dropping small bombs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller, at the window, called, &#8220;Looks like a
Fourth of July celebration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly he shouted, &#8220;<i>We got one!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the darkness, Andr&eacute; listened to the wild
whine of the falling Luftwaffe plane.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; reached Weller&#8217;s side in time to see
flames spring high above the dark treetops beyond
the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see any &#8217;chute,&#8221; Weller exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pilot may have jumped before the fire lit
up the sky,&#8221; the captain replied.</p>

<p>The sudden flare of excitement was followed by
an equally sudden lull except for the sound of soldiers&#8217;
voices across the fields. The flack guns lapsed
into silence.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie said, &#8220;Whew! Next time, Andr&eacute;,
you go down to the cellar. I forgot all about you
for a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim and a detail of men were sent off to look
for the fallen Nazi plane, and also for the pilot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better send out word to the French people
around here to be on the lookout,&#8221; Dobie added,
&#8220;till we&#8217;re sure about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Slim and the men had been gone only a
few minutes, Weller began to fidget restlessly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;How about I just take a look-see down the
road, Captain?&#8221; he suggested.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie said okay, and Weller swept up
a Tommy gun and went off into the night.</p>

<p>He had gone only a few yards when Andr&eacute;
caught up with him.</p>

<p>In a field, the last flames were flickering from
the fallen Messerschmitt. A faint drizzle blurred
the scene, but the figures of many soldiers were
dimly silhouetted against the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;No good goin&#8217; over there,&#8221; Weller said, after
studying the scene a moment.</p>

<p>They had just begun to retrace their steps when
Weller said, &#8220;Listen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had heard sounds too&mdash;a creaking and
the clop, clop of hoofbeats.</p>

<p>Coming down the wet road a new, unpainted
cart rattled into sight. Between the shafts clumped
La Fum&eacute;e. And, waving the reins behind the dashboard,
stood Victor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andr&eacute;!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Where did you go?&#8221; He
brushed at his enormous mustache nervously.
&#8220;Well, never mind now. Get in. Get in. I&#8217;ll drive
you home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gulped with relief. Weller demanded,
&#8220;Ask him how he got home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; repeated the question in French, and
Victor threw out his hands indignantly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;How <i>should</i> I come?&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;By any
open road those soldiers and tanks left for my use.
Americans, Americans everywhere! Tanks! Guns!
I have been halfway around the world to get here,
it seems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where did you find your cart? I thought it
was blown up!&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Victor&#8217;s eyebrows expressed more astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where <i>would</i> I find it? Just where Jacquard
said he would leave it, of course. Beyond his shop,
among the holly trees.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>When this was translated, Weller shook his
head. &#8220;Well, climb in an&#8217; let&#8217;s go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>La Fum&eacute;e, sensing the nearness of her own
stable, started briskly.</p>

<p>When they had said good night to Victor, Weller
yawned loudly.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; watched Weller, and laughed. &#8220;I&#8217;m
pretty sleepy, myself,&#8221; he admitted.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he was in his mother&#8217;s big
bed, sprawled sound asleep.</p>

<small><i>Andr&eacute; and the Nazi Pilot</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">F</span>ALLING into bed, Andr&eacute;&#8217;s thoughts had
turned to his family, but his worries were quickly
drowned in sleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he ran downstairs to see what
the sunrise had brought.</p>

<p>It had brought Victor.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; saw the old man&mdash;scrubbed pink and
bristling&mdash;beside the guard at the door. With Victor
was another of the village fathers&mdash;a farmer
who had once been a schoolteacher. M. Blanc was
a tall, square man, in a rough tweed suit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here,&#8221; said Victor, speaking to both
Andr&eacute; and the guard&mdash;who did not understand a
word&mdash;&#8220;about a matter which demands attention.
It is the exasperating fact that an unexploded shell
reposes in my&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>Andr&eacute; cried, &#8220;Wait!&#8221; and hastily translated for
the guard&#8217;s benefit.</p>

<p>Victor remained standing, with open mouth.
The guard shouted, and Slim came running. The
captain was swiftly consulted, and a demolition
squad was rounded up. This took only a few seconds,
since disposing of unexploded shells was an
ever-present problem.</p>

<p>On being questioned about where the &#8220;dud&#8221;
was, Victor finished his sentence. &#8220;In my parlor,
near the bay window.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the last word, the demolition crew started
running.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; asked, &#8220;But isn&#8217;t Mme. Lescot frightened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does not even know it is there,&#8221; Victor replied.
&#8220;She has been off helping with some of the
children since yesterday. I was obliged to prepare
my own supper,&#8221; he finished crossly.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie came to the door and gravely
shook hands with the two Frenchmen. He eyed
Victor curiously. After a moment&#8217;s study of the
old man, however, he decided that to order Victor
to stay out of danger would be a waste of time.</p>

<p>It was M. Blanc who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We came, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;as spokesmen for the
whole neighborhood. We wish to offer our services
in any way you Americans consider helpful. We
should also be grateful if you can tell us what to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
expect in the way of future danger to our community.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; replied Captain Dobie, &#8220;you people
have accepted all this destruction with fine, very
brave spirit. The Maquis, as well as all you other
French people, have helped the landing forces
more than you will ever know. We Americans
want you to realize that we are grateful. It could
have been much worse for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Blanc put up a hand. &#8220;Please, m&#8217;sieur, it is
our battle also. And the Maquis have told us that
the Americans up beyond Ste. M&egrave;re are heroic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain said his men had been wonderful.
&#8220;But until we dispose of these Germans, we can&#8217;t
move forward into France beyond this peninsula.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Canadians and British?&#8221; asked M.
Blanc.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve successfully landed a lot of troops and
tanks. They&#8217;ve penetrated to a considerable depth
toward Caen, I hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Bon!</i>&#8221; Victor&#8217;s head bobbed. &#8220;When you have
disposed of these bothersome Nazis you speak of&mdash;you
do what?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie frowned. &#8220;We must throw a line
of troops from these beaches straight across the
neck of the peninsula to cut off German reinforcements
from coming to the rescue of the enemy in
Cherbourg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; frowned Victor, &#8220;the Nazis will respond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
by doing all the damage possible to our fine
Cherbourg port.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid they will,&#8221; agreed the captain.
&#8220;When we take the port, our U.S. Army engineers
will have to repair the docks quickly. We intend to
bring in our main supplies for the liberation of the
rest of France through Cherbourg when it is free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capitaine Dobay,&#8221; M. Blanc said, &#8220;I suppose
no one knows how long the Germans will hold
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; replied Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>There was a second shaking of hands, and Victor
and M. Blanc left.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s mind turned anxiously to the tale of
heavy fighting which was moving toward St. Sauveur
le Vicomte and his family there. He felt more
cut off from them than ever, now that he knew
they were surrounded by such desperate enemies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has anybody found that German pilot yet?&#8221; he
asked Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No sign of him,&#8221; the captain replied. &#8220;Now,
after breakfast, I have a job for Slim. And I think
you and your dog could go along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Andr&eacute; was telling a delighted
Patchou, &#8220;They think it&#8217;s safe now, for you
to come out with me. But there&#8217;s still a war on, so
behave yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cows, he found, had again been milked by
the American farmer-soldiers, and again most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the milk had vanished. The other barn chores had
also been neatly done.</p>

<p>He heard soft sounds in the loft over the cow
barn, and crept up the stairs to investigate.</p>

<p>A dozen or more soldiers from the night patrol
were sleeping heavily in the sweet hay. Full of
good Gagnon milk, Andr&eacute; thought with pleasure.</p>

<p>He tiptoed down the stairs and, freeing Patchou
from his fastening, answered Slim&#8217;s impatient halloo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gotta find a commissary dump somewhere
down the road,&#8221; Slim explained. &#8220;Weller says it
cain&#8217;t be far. Them 90th Division cooks told him
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>After his long imprisonment, Patchou was blissfully
happy. He ran rings around Slim and Andr&eacute;.
He found excitement in every newly blasted hole
in the mossy walls, and inviting scents everywhere.</p>

<p>Slim marched rapidly along for nearly half a
mile, with Andr&eacute; keeping up at a trot. Then Slim
said, &#8220;Best we begin to ask questions now. Who,
&#8217;round here, knows everything?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; pointed to a house ahead. &#8220;That&#8217;s M.
Valjean&#8217;s home there. He&#8217;s the cobbler. He will
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Valjean listened eagerly to Andr&eacute;&#8217;s query.
Did he know where there was an American food
dump headquarters nearby?</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah-h, <i>oui, oui, certainement</i>,&#8221; the cobbler responded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
enthusiastically, and gave detailed directions
in a flood of rapid French.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; said, &#8220;I know where it is.&#8221; He added,
&#8220;<i>Merci</i>,&#8221; to M. Valjean.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure?&#8221; Slim frowned. &#8220;Sounded as if it
must be on the Russian border, what-all I could
make of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure, Slim,&#8221; Andr&eacute; replied. &#8220;It is my own
schoolhouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim&#8217;s rapidly swinging long legs kept Andr&eacute;
at an almost breathless canter. Because their
minds were silently busy, they did not hear the
word, &#8220;<i>Kamerad</i>,&#8221; when it was first spoken.</p>

<p>But Slim&#8217;s reaction to something out of key
stopped him short, .45 in hand.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was pushed back before the second,
louder, &#8220;<i>Kamerad</i>&#8221; gave him warning.</p>

<small><i>Slim and the Trumpet</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">S</span>LIM leaned forward intently, staring at a
thicket to one side. &#8220;Who&#8217;re you? Come out&mdash;hands
up!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Get back, kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>A voice said, &#8220;It is not necessary. I vish to giff
myself up&mdash;villingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>A young German airman stepped from behind
the litter of broken cherry branches.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you come from?&#8221; Slim demanded.
&#8220;Keep those hands on your head.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know who he is,&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried. Then, to the
stranger, &#8220;You&#8217;re the pilot who jumped from the
Messerschmitt, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The German nodded. &#8220;I vish to make no trouble.
Please take my gun&mdash;a Luger only, in the holster.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim snapped out the pistol. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he demanded,
&#8220;what gives here?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>The German said, &#8220;I haf vanted to giff up a long
time now. I am glad you haff come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Slim shrugged, &#8220;maybe you can explain
that to the captain. Come on. March ahead of me
to that schoolhouse yonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they reached the food dump, the prisoner
was put under guard. Meanwhile Slim carried out
the captain&#8217;s orders for food supplies. Slim
pointed to the stacked cartons he had piled in the
corner of the schoolhouse. &#8220;See nobody lays a hand
on that. A jeep&#8217;ll be over to pick it up within an
hour,&#8221; he told the commissary sergeant. He also
asked for an extra guard to accompany them back
to the captain. &#8220;He says he wants to give hisself
up,&#8221; Slim said, &#8220;but how do we know he&#8217;s on the
level?&#8221;</p>

<p>Drawing his own gun, Slim added to Andr&eacute;, as
he led the way, &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t our flack gunners like
to get a look at this Luftwaffe fellow?&#8221;</p>

<p>The prisoner smiled wryly. &#8220;Your flack gunners
already haff seen me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That is vhy I am
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>On their return, Captain Dobie greeted the
German with surprising enthusiasm. &#8220;I am delighted
to see you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You had us worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I vas vorried myself, sir,&#8221; the pilot replied.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the prisoner was dispatched
to an interrogation center by jeep, with Weller
and a guard.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>Captain Dobie suggested that Andr&eacute; find M.
Blanc and tell him that the village could forget
about that particular German pilot. &#8220;Glad to have
<i>him</i> off my mind,&#8221; the captain added.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; found M. Blanc consulting with Victor
near the end of the village and gave them the captain&#8217;s
good news.</p>

<p>En route home through the fields, Andr&eacute; found
an almost undamaged yellow parachute. &#8220;How
beautiful Marie will be in a dress of yellow silk!&#8221;
he thought. And he folded it carefully, tucking the
bulky load under his arm.</p>

<p>That evening, after supper, Andr&eacute; took his
trumpet into the kitchen. He gathered cleaning
rags and polish, and rubbed and cleaned the brass
of the horn. When the tubes had been cleared and
the metal gleamed, he piped a little trill of lonely
notes.</p>

<p>They made him feel no better, and he tried a
Normandy dance tune.</p>

<p>He heard the clump of feet behind him and
Slim&#8217;s voice. &#8220;Holy cow! <i>Where</i> did you get that
horn?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; put the trumpet down shyly. Slim picked
it up carefully and rubbed the mouthpiece with
his sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you play a trumpet?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Waal ... I used to play some in the school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
band in Pecos, Texas. Matter of fact, I was pretty
good. Shall I give &#8217;er a try?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; jumped when a ringing peal of notes rose
from the brass to the rafters. The notes slid down
the scale, and Slim broke loudly into &#8220;Turkey in
the Straw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller&#8217;s bellow rose even above the music&#8217;s vibrations.
&#8220;Stop that racket!&#8221; Slim guiltily took the
horn from his lips. The sergeant shouted, &#8220;Captain&#8217;s
on the phone to headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; Slim whispered. &#8220;Suppose
we go try this out somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the next hour, in the dimly lit springhouse,
Andr&eacute; enjoyed himself more than he had for
weeks. And when Slim said, &#8220;Time for bed now,&#8221;
Andr&eacute; had learned half of Slim&#8217;s pet song, which
was something about Texas.</p>

<p>Next morning, Andr&eacute; found that a thick fog,
almost a drizzle, hung over the treetops. The soft
gray mist hid the harsh destruction of the landscape.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; went out to find Raoul at work patching
the Coty roof. &#8220;Just help me with this thatch, will
you?&#8221; Raoul called.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gladly climbed up the old ladder with an
armful of straw while Raoul chattered.</p>

<p>But a moment later he stopped listening to
Raoul&#8217;s talk. Somewhere in the fog, he had detected
the uncertain throbbing of a plane&#8217;s engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_108.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Andr&eacute; had learned half of Slim&#8217;s pet song</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>He sat still to follow the sound. The plane was
flying in wide circles, steadily coming in lower.</p>

<p>In a drift of the mist, Andr&eacute; caught a glimpse of
the markings&mdash;a white star.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in trouble, Raoul. That&#8217;s an American
plane,&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he be in trouble?&#8221; Raoul objected.
&#8220;He&#8217;s still in the sky, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>But listening closely, he too, heard the engine
sputter. &#8220;That engine needs repairs!&#8221; he declared
disapprovingly.</p>

<p>Hastily, Andr&eacute; shouted, &#8220;DUCK!&#8221;</p>

<p>Their heads went down as the plane&#8217;s wings,
trailing wisps of fog, swept close overhead. Andr&eacute;
had just time to make out a high-wing monoplane
with patches and holes in its fabric covering.</p>

<p>The plane banked, sailed over a field behind the
Coty house, and was set down expertly.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was already scrambling down the ladder.</p>

<p>He pelted across the meadow with no thought
of danger. Racing toward the plane, he thought
only that the pilot might be hurt. Through the
plexiglass enclosure of the little ship, Andr&eacute; saw
a blond young fellow, in an odd, peaked cap.</p>

<p>At the sound of pounding footsteps, the pilot
whirled, an automatic suddenly in his hand and
pointed at Andr&eacute;.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br />


<small><i>The War from the Air</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>NDR&Eacute; was so surprised that he stammered,
in English, &#8220;D&mdash;don&#8217;t fire!&#8221;</p>

<p>The flyer&#8217;s hand dropped. &#8220;<i>Parlez-vous</i> English?&#8221;
he faltered, frowning.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s suspicions leaped up. Dirty brown
coveralls, the strange cap, the German-looking,
tow-colored hair. And the plane. Andr&eacute; had never
seen one like it, and the star insigne could be a
Nazi fake.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; stood his ground, some distance away.
When the pilot flung open the side door and
jumped out, Andr&eacute; stepped back.</p>

<p>In a swift glance over his shoulder, Andr&eacute; saw
Raoul reach the bottom of the ladder. He shouted,
&#8220;Run get Slim, Raoul. And tell the captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the love of Mike, kid, what gives with you?
You think I&#8217;m a German?&#8221; the pilot demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could be,&#8221; Andr&eacute; retorted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;Holy mackerel!&#8221; the pilot laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s
what I thought you were, at first. I didn&#8217;t even see
you were a kid when I pulled the gun. Forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Andr&eacute; admitted after a moment, &#8220;you
do talk like an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How come?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; laughed uncertainly. &#8220;Germans don&#8217;t say
&#8216;How come,&#8217; for one thing,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;But what
<i>are</i> you doing here? It looks as though you were
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost is right&mdash;and out of fuel, too,&#8221; the pilot
replied with angry disgust. &#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got to find
more gas and get over to Utah Beach in a hurry.
Where am I, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are about four miles from the nearest invasion
beach,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure of
the different names you Americans have given
them. Someone will be here soon. Captain Dobie
can&#8217;t come himself, he has a broken leg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this Dobie&#8217;s command?&#8221; the flyer exclaimed.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m in a hurry. Cripes! I can&#8217;t keep the general
waiting. He&#8217;ll give me hoop-la for navigating
myself into this mess&mdash;fog or no fog. Here&#8217;s somebody
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Slim, at a gallop, followed by two armed
guards. They fell in on each side of the pilot.</p>

<p>Slim took a quick look at the flyer and the plane,
and asked, &#8220;What outfit <i>you</i> with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Army Liaison Squadron, Lieutenant Bill Carson,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
replied the pilot. &#8220;You with the 82nd Airborne?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim nodded and asked sharply, &#8220;Now, what&#8217;s
up here? Don&#8217;t you guys use landin&#8217; strips any
more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pile it on, buddy,&#8221; Carson said. &#8220;I&#8217;m in
bad enough already. I got myself lost good, in this
weather. And this kid here thought I was a German&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim turned sternly to Andr&eacute;. &#8220;You can overdo
this takin&#8217; prisoners without consultin&#8217; us, you
know, son,&#8221; he muttered coldly.</p>

<p>He explained to the pilot, more mildly, &#8220;This
Andr&eacute; and an old Frenchman helped catch a car
full of Nazi officers once. But once is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lieutenant stared at Andr&eacute;. &#8220;Say,&#8221; he exclaimed,
&#8220;are you the French kid I heard about?
Trapped those German staff officers? I bet my general&#8217;d
like to shake hands with you. He&#8217;s the one
who questioned them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim put on his best corporal&#8217;s manner. &#8220;Best
we get back to your business here, Lieutenant.
How are you going to wangle your jalopy out of
this corner, now you got her wedged in so good?&#8221;</p>

<p>The pilot shrugged. &#8220;Get me some gas, and I&#8217;ll
fly out okay. Might have to wait till the fog lifts a
little.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim pondered a moment. &#8220;Listen, Andr&eacute;. You
think we could squeeze a little more gas out of that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
pump of your dad&#8217;s? Take us an hour or more to
waylay a U. S. truck carryin&#8217; gas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; smiled. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been telling everyone the
pump was empty, but we have a little left in case
of&mdash;you know&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Carson gave a yelp. &#8220;I know&mdash;emergency, you
mean. Well, boys, I&#8217;m the worst emergency you&#8217;ll
ever meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim ordered one of his men to guard the plane.
At a frown from the guard, Raoul, who had been
standing close by, stalked off.</p>

<p>At the house Slim went in to report to the captain
and came back with word that Dobie had telephoned
the general waiting at Utah Beach.</p>

<p>The general had sent a message to Carson:
&#8220;What did that idiot mean by getting stuck in a
blasted cow pasture? And tell him to get out of
there in a blasted hurry, or I&#8217;ll have his blasted
...&#8221; and so forth.</p>

<p>Carson smiled wanly. &#8220;That&#8217;s my general,&#8221; he
said.</p>

<p>Slim went back to duty, and Andr&eacute; and the pilot
refilled the plane&#8217;s tank from the cans they had
brought from the Gagnon pump.</p>

<p>Carson took a dismal look at the gray-blanketed
landscape. With Andr&eacute;&#8217;s help, he rolled the machine
around so that it headed away from the
hedge. &#8220;Want to get in while I taxi her into position?&#8221;
Carson asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;You are permitted&mdash;?&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried.</p>

<p>Carson laughed. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m not permitted&mdash;but
what&#8217;s the difference? Climb in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; clambered into the seat beside the pilot&#8217;s.
Carson turned a switch, adjusted the throttle,
swung the propeller, and the engine started
promptly. &#8220;Now, fasten that seat belt and hold on,
this field&#8217;s bumpy.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a surge of power, the plane began to move.
Skillfully the pilot ruddered a jolting course
around the potholes and stumps, to the far corner
of the meadow. &#8220;Need all the run I can get for the
take-off,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>Faced around for a diagonal course, he throttled
the engine. &#8220;Gosh, I think the fog is beginning to
break,&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>He leaned out to observe the wind direction
which already was beginning to ruffle the tops of
the trees.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d feel better if I knew this country,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;You know it like your own hand, I suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; said he did, and the pilot stared down at
him thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; Carson broke out again. &#8220;How about you
coming along for the ride, and point out landmarks
for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s eyes lit up. &#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seen the Invasion beaches yet? I&#8217;ll show
them to you,&#8221; he offered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>Before Andr&eacute; could gather his wits, Carson exclaimed,
&#8220;There&#8217;s a patch of blue sky! We better
grab this chance. Hang on. Here we go!&#8221; And he
pushed open the throttle.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; felt the engine quicken and then the forward
jolt as the brakes were released.</p>

<p>Smoothly, the little ship lifted after the short
run. Banking sharply, it swept toward the far rim
of trees and, with inches to spare, skimmed over
them.</p>

<p>The mist was breaking up, revealing open vistas.
As the plane rose, the houses and fields below
shrank away swiftly.</p>

<p>The pilot said, &#8220;Keep a close watch for low-flying
bombers. They&#8217;re all over the place today,
cleaning out isolated German pockets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Almost at once they were over the marshes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our road to the sea.&#8221; Andr&eacute; pointed.</p>

<p>The mists broke away sharply over the Channel.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; gasped.</p>

<p>A staggering panorama had been unveiled.
Pigmy files of marching troops, pigmy tanks and
trucks crawled up the sea road in an endless procession.
Oceanward, beyond the shore bluff and
wreck-strewn beach, lay a sight which Andr&eacute; could
scarcely take in. Hundreds of ships extended as far
as he could see across the gray waves. Over the
ships, huge balloons lolled and bobbed and tugged
at their anchors. Destroyers and landing craft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
darted between the shore and a line of hundreds of
transports.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; could make out a fleet of planes heading
toward Cherbourg to the north. And from that direction,
the dull thud of bombs rolled back on the
wet air.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is grand,&#8221; he managed to say breathlessly.
&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; he hesitated, and added slowly, &#8220;it is terrible
for the French people. So many guns and
bombs pointed at us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Carson glanced down at him. &#8220;They are pointed
at the Germans,&#8221; he corrected Andr&eacute;. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget
that we&#8217;re trying not to hurt France more than
necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Oui</i>, I know,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said. &#8220;But sir, I did not
know there were so many ships and guns in the
whole world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Carson, &#8220;take a good look while
you&#8217;ve got the chance. I&#8217;ve got my bearings now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; studied the beach below. In the shallow
water, wrecked landing craft swung uselessly, half-awash.
On the sea&#8217;s edge lay tanks which had
reached shore only to be shelled into wreckage.
Savage battles had turned the sands into a disorder
of blasted, blackened gun pits and machine-gun
nests.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Twice, while Carson circled, Andr&eacute; saw him
fiddling with the radio. Then he spoke into the
hand microphone, and listened for a few moments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got &#8217;em at last,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They say we&#8217;ve got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
to hold off awhile longer. Some Luftwaffe guy got
through last night and bombed the strip. They&#8217;re
just finishing repairs. See them down there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked directly down. Tiny men laying
strips of steel mesh moved in groups, like ants.
Bulldozers swept along one side. And between the
airstrip and the sea, supplies were piling up steadily
into mountains.</p>

<p>Carson grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet that&#8217;s my general pacing
up and down in front of that big tent.&#8221; A second
later, he said, &#8220;As long as we can&#8217;t get down
right away, how about we take a look at the English
and Canadian beachheads?&#8221;</p>

<p>He swung alongshore and headed eastward.</p>

<p>Carson pointed out the little city of Carentan.
There was a rattle of machine guns below, and
the pilot threw the plane into a series of violent
turns. Noises like angry wasps streaked past their
ears.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; swayed dizzily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-oh! What am I doing in here?&#8221; Carson
yelled. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way I get holes in my ship.&#8221;
He pointed out new tears in the fabric. As they
zoomed away, he explained, &#8220;That was a Nazi
machine-gun. There are still German troops and
guns between Utah and Omaha Beaches and the
British beachheads.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plane climbed steadily away, and Andr&eacute;
relaxed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>The fury of Omaha and the British beaches was
very like that which he had seen at Utah.</p>

<p>Unconsciously, Andr&eacute; shuddered. Far to the
right, under a pall of smoke and the flickering of
explosions, lay a city being pounded to rubble.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be Caen,&#8221; Andr&eacute; murmured. &#8220;My
mother was born in Caen.&#8221; Then, after a moment,
&#8220;The houses, the farms, the cows and the horses
... the people ...&#8221; he counted sadly.</p>

<p>Carson sat thoughtfully quiet. He swung the
ship in a wide circle for the return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think about it, kid,&#8221; he said presently.
&#8220;Just remember the big German guns that aren&#8217;t
there any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; replied slowly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we really
knew the Liberation would be as bad as this. We
will be glad when it is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the pilot jammed his control stick
forward. The plane nosed into a violent dive.
&#8220;Hang on! Fighters overhead. Up there!&#8221; he
shouted.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s head had jerked back. In his range of
vision, a formation of six Thunderbolts with
white stars roared past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; Carson gasped, and pulled the ship
level.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after a bridge,&#8221; he yelled.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; watched plane after plane go into a dive
and the bombs leave the racks to arc downward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>In the successive rain of bombs a black, flame-flecked
cloud shot skyward.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have hit it!&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried jubilantly.</p>

<p>The Thunderbolts zoomed upward out of the
haze, reformed, and disappeared toward England.</p>

<p>Some time later, Carson talked once more into
the radio. &#8220;It&#8217;s okay. They say to come in now.
The runway&#8217;s ready,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>He throttled back. &#8220;Well, now you know what
the beaches are like,&#8221; he sighed. There was a
smooth descent, Carson slid in over the steel mesh
and brought the machine to a stop beside a group
of officers.</p>

<p>He snapped open his own seat belt and Andr&eacute;&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-oh!&#8221; Carson gasped. &#8220;I&#8217;d better try to
explain <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked across at a glistening, brilliant
red face that belonged to a bulky man in a sweat-stained
uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the general,&#8221; Carson whispered. He
pushed the door open and saluted.</p>

<p>He spoke more rapidly than usual. &#8220;This is the
French boy, sir, who helped catch the Nazi brass
from Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>The general seemed to be caught between fury
and curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it!&#8221; he sputtered at last. &#8220;And <i>what&#8217;s</i> he
doing in an army plane?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir&mdash;&#8221; Carson blinked. &#8220;I needed&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;Oh, never mind,&#8221; boomed the general explosively.
&#8220;He&#8217;s here now, and I want to shake hands
with him. Come on, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; leaped down from the plane, and his
hand disappeared in the general&#8217;s bear clutch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to thank you personally&mdash;&#8221; roared the
huge man gruffly.</p>

<p>He mopped his neck. &#8220;Want to tell you&mdash;what&#8217;s
your name again? Andr&eacute; Gunion? Can&#8217;t get these
foreign names. Rotten at languages, but I can
judge people. Where&#8217;s that old fellow&mdash;friend of
yours&mdash;Vilmer, was it?&mdash;who shot the tires off the
Nazis?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had tried to speak several times. Now, he
said loudly, &#8220;Victor&mdash;Lescot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lescot? Lescot? That means green vegetable,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; barked the general. &#8220;No? Well, never
mind. Congratulate him for me. Found out a lot
from those Nazi colonels, we did. Tell you what.
We expect the biggest generals we got, here on this
bridgehead in a couple of days&mdash;Eisenhower, Marshall,
Arnold. They&#8217;ll be glad to know how you
French kids have helped.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for breath. &#8220;Well, got to get going.
Lieutenant!&#8221;</p>

<p>Carson emerged from inspecting the bullet
holes in the plane, again chattering rapidly. &#8220;How
are we going to get this boy home, sir? He can&#8217;t
walk. It&#8217;s too far.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>The general snorted. &#8220;Send him in a jeep, of
course&mdash;with some new orders for Captain Dobie.&#8221;</p>

<p>An iron-faced sergeant appeared and saluted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there you are, Streukoff,&#8221; shouted the general.
&#8220;Take this boy to Captain Dobie. Boy knows
where his command post is, over there somewhere.&#8221;
He jerked a large thumb toward inland
Normandy.</p>

<p>At the plane, he called back, &#8220;And mind you get
a receipt for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Carson called to Andr&eacute;, &#8220;We had fun, eh? Be
seeing you,&#8221; and opened the throttle.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, a jeep bearing Andr&eacute; in the
front seat, rocketed around a line of trucks and
soldiers into Andr&eacute;&#8217;s own village.</p>

<p>He had been busy for some minutes thinking
how he was to explain his trip to Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>As the jeep rolled down the village street Andr&eacute;
saw that something unusual had happened. The
neighbors were running toward a little gathering
of people.</p>

<p>His eyes raced over them and stopped.</p>

<p>In front of the parish house, worn, gray with
fatigue, his clothes dusty and torn, loomed a tall
old man.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s heart stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Father Duprey!&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<small><i>Father Duprey&#8217;s Story</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">&#8220;M</span>Y DEAR boy!&#8221; Father Duprey held out his
arms.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; cleared the space to the parsonage steps
as though shot from the jeep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did my mother come&mdash;my father&mdash;Marie?&#8221;
he cried.</p>

<p>He looked up at the priest&#8217;s long, bony face,
lined with weariness, and halted. The old man&#8217;s
embrace was kind, but Andr&eacute; knew at once that
the news he brought was not good. His expression
held too much sadness.</p>

<p>&#8220;The father needs rest,&#8221; someone in the crowd
of neighbors called out. And Anna, the parsonage
housekeeper, bustled from the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, come in, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; she called anxiously.
&#8220;And bring in the father. I will give you
tea. And <i>then</i> you may talk.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_124.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;My dear boy!&#8221; Father Duprey held out his arms</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>&#8220;I must tell you, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; Father Duprey said,
&#8220;my news of your family is not too bad. So do not
be anxious. However, I do not know where all of
them are now. But come into the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>After tea was served, the old man sighed deeply.
&#8220;Now, Andr&eacute;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to relieve your anxiety
as well as I can.</p>

<p>&#8220;To begin. The hospital where we left your
mother is small. And it is well outside the town of
St. Sauveur le Vicomte&mdash;in the country, really.
The doctors there are good. Your father, Marie,
and I waited for some time to get a report from
them about your mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;At about ten-thirty o&#8217;clock, Monday night&mdash;that
was June 5th&mdash;one of the doctors came to tell
us that Mme. Gagnon needed only the right medicine
and a week or two to get well. That is good
news, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; sighed. &#8220;Yes, very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! another thing.&#8221; The priest held up a thin
finger. &#8220;The Maquis met us exactly on time, at
the rendezvous not far from the hospital. And
your brave English flyer&mdash;Ronald Pitt&mdash;ran for it.
What a sight! Two of the roughest looking of our
Maquis and a nun, racing toward a near-by building.
But&mdash;well, they got away safely. That <i>was</i>
good, no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonderful,&#8221; Andr&eacute; murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then. At about eleven-thirty that night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
your father and I stood at the hospital door. We
were to start back home, and Marie was to stay
with your mother. We heard bombing all around
us. Your father said, &#8216;The bombing is getting bad.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just as he said that, we heard loud shouting in
German, and Nazis began pouring out of their
camp onto the roads.</p>

<p>&#8220;A minute later there was the sound of motorcycles
and cars shrieking in the streets, and heavy
antiaircraft fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone cried out, &#8216;The Invasion has begun!
<i>Parachutists are landing all around Ste. M&egrave;re!</i>&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father felt that his duty was to remain
with Mme. Gagnon. I, that my duty was to hasten
home. And I promised to look after you, Andr&eacute;.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man smiled wryly. &#8220;I did not have
much chance to do that, did I?</p>

<p>&#8220;In the midst of it, Marie appeared. She was
with Leon Duplis, a Maquis I know well.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said, &#8216;Father, the Maquis here need women
to help with the villagers. Please do not forbid me
to go. In the hospital, Mother is in good hands.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father agreed, but not willingly. In another
minute Marie and Leon were on a motorcycle
and out of sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how did you get home, father? It has been
five days,&#8221; asked Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>The priest replied, &#8220;It was necessary to follow
the loneliest roads through the confusion. One did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
not know where the shells or the snipers&#8217; bullets
would strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I slept well enough under hedges,&#8221; the priest
continued. &#8220;I was very kindly given food by many
villagers. Sometimes I took refuge in a church or
house. At times I was able to help with the
wounded and ill. And sometimes I stopped to comfort
the children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Father Duprey rose and put a kindly hand on
Andr&eacute;&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;I am glad that you were spared,
son. Go home now, and do not worry. Even about
Marie. The Gagnons are a family that for two
hundred years has not been easily crushed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; went slowly down the parsonage steps....
On the first night of the invasion his parents
had been safe. But that was four days ago, he
thought.</p>

<p>A loud shout stopped him. Streukoff beckoned
from the jeep. &#8220;Hey, kid! Say, I gotta deliver you
and get a receipt from Captain Dobie. Git in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked shocked. &#8220;The general was joking,
wasn&#8217;t he? I can walk the short distance home.
I&#8217;m sorry I kept you waiting so long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right. I needed the rest,&#8221; grinned
Streukoff. &#8220;But I&#8217;m getting that receipt, boy. A
general never forgets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie looked up from his desk irritably
when Streukoff entered the room and saluted.
Andr&eacute; followed well in the rear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Dobie snapped.</p>

<p>After hearing the general&#8217;s request, he barked,
&#8220;You want <i>what</i>? You brought Andr&eacute; home? From
<i>where</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>At one side, Weller muttered, &#8220;I should &#8217;a&#8217;
known better. I should &#8217;a&#8217; known better.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain scribbled out a receipt for Streukoff
and signed it. He then registered his feelings by
banging weights down on all the papers on his
desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never even <i>missed</i> him,&#8221; he said through
closed lips.</p>

<p>The telephone jangled, and Andr&eacute; saw Weller
turn to Captain Dobie excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the colonel,&#8221; Weller shouted. &#8220;We&#8217;re
movin&#8217; this command post up to the other side of
Ste. M&egrave;re! The 9th division is almost set to help
us on a big push.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller turned his eyes slowly on Andr&eacute;.</p>

<small><i>Battle for St. Sauveur</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">T</span>HE idea of Captain Dobie&#8217;s staff going away
came as a shock to Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;B-but&mdash;&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie and Weller consulted maps and
papers. At last, the captain sat back and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve seen Father Duprey? What did he have
to tell you?&#8221; he inquired mildly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very good news, sir,&#8221; Andr&eacute; replied. &#8220;But
nothing especially bad ... I wish my family
could get home,&#8221; he said irritably.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie cocked an eyebrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish they could, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And, as long
as I am responsible here, maybe you&#8217;d like to tell
me why you went off with that pilot in his plane.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this unexpected shift, Andr&eacute; flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not tell me not to, sir,&#8221; he said shyly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;I did not tell you not to ride an elephant to
Afghanistan, either,&#8221; the captain retorted. &#8220;How
could I know you had any intention of flying over
the enemy?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I did not know it myself.&#8221; Andr&eacute; could not
help smiling. &#8220;It just happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re lucky to be back. I don&#8217;t suppose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
it really matters if I turn gray worrying about
you,&#8221; said the captain.</p>

<p>A bark from Patchou in the kitchen gave Andr&eacute;
an excuse to bolt away.</p>

<p>Although Captain Dobie&#8217;s colonel had ordered
the post moved closer to the fighting, the change
would not come until other units were in position.</p>

<p>During the next couple of days Andr&eacute;&#8217;s mind
turned more and more toward St. Sauveur. If he
could only go forward with Dobie and Weller and
Slim, to be near when that town was liberated.
Other French children were in the battle zone.
And, after all, he had been under fire himself.</p>

<p>St. Sauveur, Weller explained, was directly in
the path of the Americans who were hammering
through to the coast to keep the Germans from
sending help to the fortress at Cherbourg. The 9th
Division and their own 82nd Airborne were working
together in this drive for the showdown.</p>

<p>Weller came home from an errand to the beach
on Tuesday, the 13th, whistling gaily, off key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good news?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>Weller replied, &#8220;Tops. We wiped the Nazis out
of that gap between Utah and Omaha beachheads.
Now we can roll! And boy! You ought to see our
new Utah airstrip. Planes goin&#8217; to London out of
there&mdash;like ferries&mdash;with the wounded.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie, talking to his colonel on the
phone, hung up, looking cheerful.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;The towns along the Merderet River seem to
be pretty well mopped up,&#8221; he reported. &#8220;We
hold the bridges. So the way to the Douve River&#8217;s
clear now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Later that day Weller made a fast trip to the
new command post. He came back to report that a
small stone farm building near a crossroads north
of Pont l&#8217;Abb&eacute; had been found for Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got a pair of new lieutenants takin&#8217; the
places of a couple that got wounded,&#8221; Weller said.
&#8220;Good fighters, these replacements, Schoenfargle
an&#8217; Ouvarski.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; grew more silent as the captain&#8217;s leaving
day drew near.</p>

<p>St. Sauveur was to Andr&eacute; a pretty little town
where his family were. As each day went by he
felt more anxious about his mother. And finally
he decided he must follow Dobie and look for her.</p>

<p>On the last evening, Captain Dobie said, &#8220;I&#8217;m
leaving Slim here for a few days, on orders, Andr&eacute;.
He&#8217;ll be in touch with me, so send us word if anything
is wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller echoed, &#8220;Yeah. You do that, kid, and
you just tend to the cows, and mind what Father
Duprey says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; was up and the house astir before sunrise
next morning.</p>

<p>Maps, papers, and duffle were stacked waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
in the hallway when Slim appeared at the door and
announced, &#8220;Jeep&#8217;s ready, Captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the bad moment for Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Dobie hobbled out to the jeep and Weller followed.
Several of the neighbors, including Father
Duprey and Victor, had come to say good-by.</p>

<p>Patchou kept up a nervous barking, shocked by
the departure of friends, until Andr&eacute; put an arm
around him.</p>

<p>Over the noisy complaint of the jeep&#8217;s motor,
Captain Dobie thanked all those gathered there
for their help. And he asked that thanks be given
to the Gagnons.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you all again,&#8221; he smiled, clutching at
his seat as the jeep leaped forward.</p>

<p>And up to the overhanging chestnut trees rang
cries of &#8220;<i>Vive l&#8217;Am&eacute;rique!</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>Vive le Capitaine
Dobay!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The last Andr&eacute; heard was Weller&#8217;s voice, bellowing,
&#8220;Vive la Frenchmen!&#8221;</p>

<p>The silence of the house, as the sun slid up over
the trees, was numbing.</p>

<p>Mme. Lescot arrived to break this up, equipped
with an armload of cleaning things.</p>

<p>&#8220;This place resembles a pigsty,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;Mme. Gagnon must not see such a mess. Please
cause yourself to be absent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim hurriedly remembered a job to be done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Andr&eacute; pushed Patchou hastily out of doors and
went to milk the cows.</p>

<p>He had just put the milk to cool when Mme.
Lescot hailed him from the kitchen door. &#8220;Breakfast!&#8221;
she called.</p>

<p>When Slim and Andr&eacute; drew up to the table,
Mme. Lescot produced a breakfast of army supplies
she had found on a shelf.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not my business,&#8221; she said shortly, &#8220;to
complain about God&#8217;s behavior. But I cannot
help believing He has encouraged the American
Army to habits of extravagance. Do you leave good
food behind, everywhere you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>When this was translated into English, Slim
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am!&#8221; he said emphatically. &#8220;This army
eats everything it lays its hands on. Weller&#8217;s just
repayin&#8217; the Gagnons for the use of their house, I
guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast, Slim called for Andr&eacute; and the
trumpet. Fitted in between his duties, Slim gave
Andr&eacute; more lessons in American tunes. The old
house trembled under the blasts.</p>

<p>In the midst of one of Slim&#8217;s Texas songs, an
ambulance full of wounded from the fighting at
St. Sauveur drew up and stopped.</p>

<p>The driver had a message about Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n&#8217;s got himself shot in the shoulder,&#8221; he
reported.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Andr&eacute; and Slim froze.</p>

<p>The driver added, as he started on, &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t
get him to come away and be evacuated home with
these other guys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Weller doin&#8217; lettin&#8217; the skipper get
shot!&#8221; Slim exclaimed. &#8220;Best I get up there quick,
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had decided to &#8220;get up there,&#8221; too.</p>

<p>He could surely get far enough to trace Marie,
and perhaps find some clue to where his father and
mother were.</p>

<p>Late that evening of D-day plus nine, Weller
returned to pick up Slim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Corporal,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;The cap&#8217;n
needs you.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;ll take St. Sauveur in a couple
of days,&#8221; he told Andr&eacute;. &#8220;Then, as soon&#8217;s we cut
through to the coast, the big push up to Cherbourg
starts off. Won&#8217;t be long now.... Take care
y&#8217;self, kid.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two waved from the jeep. &#8220;Be seein&#8217; you,&#8221;
they called.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; answered, &#8220;<i>Oui</i>&mdash;yes. I think so. Soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Because of his own plans, Slim&#8217;s departure did
not leave Andr&eacute; quite so lonely as he might have
been.</p>

<p>The question of <i>how</i> to get near St. Sauveur was
the problem. Andr&eacute; thought he might ask some
pleasant-looking officer for a lift. He might&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>In the end it was Victor who solved things very
simply.</p>

<p>The Lescots&#8217; married daughter&#8217;s home had been
burned out. She had just sent word that she was
at a farm near Picauville, a hamlet just outside
Pont l&#8217;Abb&eacute;. The message begged her father to
come, please, and get her.</p>

<p>On the morning after Slim&#8217;s departure, Victor
arrived at the Gagnons&#8217; door with La Fum&eacute;e and
the cart. He explained his journey to Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried, &#8220;I must go with you, Victor.
You cannot speak English any better than you
did when we went to Jacquard&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true enough,&#8221; Victor admitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. I go. I translate when soldiers try to stop
you,&#8221; Andr&eacute; announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is an idea,&#8221; Victor agreed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then?&#8221; Andr&eacute; cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cows,&#8221; Victor chided.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; paused. &#8220;Raoul?&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Do you
think he would milk them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most certainly. And steal the milk, equally certainly,&#8221;
Victor said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask him,&#8221; Andr&eacute; decided. &#8220;Wait, <i>please</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Victor sat impatiently in the cart and polished
his glasses while Andr&eacute; raced across the field.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later Andr&eacute; was back. Raoul had
agreed. And La Fum&eacute;e was plodding steadily toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Ste. M&egrave;re and the clatter and shriek of gunfire.
Crouching under a blanket at Andr&eacute;&#8217;s feet lay
Patchou.</p>

<p>The Gagnon house stood silently empty for the
first time in weeks.</p>

<p>About noon a black motorcycle rolled to a stop
beside the Gagnon pump. Marie, in dark slacks
and a man&#8217;s cap similar to the driver&#8217;s, dismounted.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_137.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;The house looks empty, Leon,&#8221; she said,
alarm in her voice.</p>

<p>She pushed open the door and called, &#8220;Andr&eacute;.&#8221;
There was no answer as she entered the empty
hallway.</p>

<p>Hurriedly, she ran through the house in a panic,
and returned to the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t here, Leon,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The house is
empty. Even Patchou is gone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>Leon looked at her calmly. &#8220;Perhaps you are
not the only adventurous one in the family,&#8221; he
laughed.</p>

<p>Aghast at the thought of Andr&eacute; wandering who
knows where, Marie paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did hope he had a letter from Maman telling
us where the hospital has moved to. And now I
don&#8217;t even know what has happened to Andr&eacute;,&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>She looked wildly around the village.</p>

<p>Darting between passing trucks she came to the
Lescot kitchen. A few minutes later she returned
to Leon, breathless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andr&eacute; has gone off toward St. Sauveur with
Victor,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Perhaps we can catch up
with them on the road to Pont l&#8217;Abb&eacute;. We must
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The black motorcycle shot off in the direction
of Ste. M&egrave;re.</p>

<small><i>Andr&eacute; into the Fighting</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span>NDR&Eacute;&#8217;s trip with Victor was unexpectedly
easy at the beginning.</p>

<p>When they passed through Ste. M&egrave;re, the town
seemed almost quiet, although the litter and destruction
on all sides were heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Beyond the town, the roads were clogged.</p>

<p>Victor was not challenged as they wove through
marching troops and rolling equipment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks very unpleasant ahead of us,&#8221; Victor
stated disapprovingly, when they had crossed
the Merderet River bridge.</p>

<p>Shell bursts, dust and smoke hung over the once
orderly fields and patches of woods. Noises burst
out loudly behind clumps of trees and died away.</p>

<p>Presently, Victor announced: &#8220;We proceed but
a short distance farther along this road. At an oak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
tree ahead we turn left to the village where my
daughter is.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was then that Andr&eacute; put forward his own
plans. He watched Victor&#8217;s look of shocked surprise
anxiously. Suppose Victor would not let him
go?</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Victor said, &#8220;you know I cannot accompany
you into St. Sauveur now. Surely you
comprehend that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; said firmly, &#8220;I did not expect it, Victor.
I go on with Patchou only. Captain Dobie is near
here, so I won&#8217;t be alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as Andr&eacute; said this, he began to doubt
whether Captain Dobie would welcome him. He
also began to wonder whether he could find the
captain&#8217;s new post.</p>

<p>As he and Victor drew nearer St. Sauveur,
Andr&eacute; began to notice that the sound of firing
came from many directions. He turned his eyes
from north to south and counted several rising
pillars of smoke. Sometimes the ground shuddered
and rocked the cart.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be easy to enter the city,&#8221; he
thought.</p>

<p>But after he and Victor had talked a minute,
Victor agreed to let him go.</p>

<p>&#8220;However, you must use good sense,&#8221; Victor
said, as Andr&eacute; climbed down from the cart. &#8220;Do
not approach a single German, even if he looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
kindly. You must recall that not all Nazis are like
our Papa Schmidt.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this good advice, he added, &#8220;You are quite
right to seek your mother. I shall no doubt get
along without you well enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this, he clacked the reins and drove off.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; and Patchou skirted the jumbled rubble
that had once been the village of Pont l&#8217;Abb&eacute;.
They continued on through bypaths and across
fields.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you stay close to me, you may walk,&#8221; Andr&eacute;
told Patchou. Patchou trotted along obediently,
his trembling shoulder pressed tightly against
Andr&eacute;&#8217;s leg.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; looked at the skyline ahead. As he stared,
new blazes broke out. Billowing smoke hung over
St. Sauveur beyond the hills. After a moment he
realized that the city was being bombarded by big
guns.</p>

<p>&#8220;We may as well get as close to Maman as we
can,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Come along, Patchou.&#8221; He
could see a file of soldiers, hugging the roadside
and straggling toward the city.</p>

<p>He led Patchou into a cowpath and they
trudged on.</p>

<p>Twice Andr&eacute; pulled Patchou down into a ditch
as rifle and machine gun fire broke out in near-by
villages.</p>

<p>After the second dive into a ditch, Andr&eacute; sat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
thoughtfully silent. It would be better to go back,
he knew. But then he thought of his empty
house&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Patchou,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;When we
get across the main road to St. Sauveur, just over
there, we will try to find somebody to tell us how
to find Maman in the hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>They scurried across the tree-lined highway.</p>

<p>Where they crossed, the road seemed deserted.
Andr&eacute; could not see far in any direction. Back in
the fields a stone barn stood among shredded trees
below a hill. A ch&acirc;teau stood on the hilltop,
almost hidden by trees.</p>

<p>Just as Andr&eacute; looked up, a shell arched down
from the sky a hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Before Andr&eacute; could grab Patchou&#8217;s collar the
explosion showered them both with stones and
mud.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_142.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>Andr&eacute; reached wildly for Patchou and ran headlong
with him into the field toward the nearest
building he could see&mdash;the stone barn.</p>

<p>The blast of another shell threw Andr&eacute; onto his
face in a hail of debris. And Patchou twisted with
a wild jerk and broke away.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; leaped to his feet, shrieking, &#8220;Patchou!
Patchou!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Patchou had disappeared! And while
Andr&eacute; called wildly, another voice shouted,
&#8220;Here, kid! Come here! The barn! Run, kid&mdash;<i>run</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The scream of another &#8220;88&#8221; from the sky
brought Andr&eacute; to his senses.</p>

<p>He saw a figure in the half-open door of the
barn waving to him frantically.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; raced up to the entrance and threw himself
into the arms of the tall soldier who had
called. The door banged shut and the bolt was
shot. Immediately a patter of machine-gun bullets
rattled against the broad iron hinges. The
hail of bullets whined and thudded steadily.</p>

<p>Another voice in the barn shouted angrily,
&#8220;<i>Where</i> are the reinforcements, Lieutenant
Ouvarski? Our ammo isn&#8217;t going to hold out much
longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The strong arms that had pulled Andr&eacute; in set
him on his feet, and he caught a glimpse of a lieutenant&#8217;s
shoulder bars.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The lieutenant said gently, &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, boy.
But what were you doing in the battle area?&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; could only gasp for breath. After a moment
he stammered, &#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t know I was so
close to the line. Patchou? Can I get him soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>The light, from broken places in the roof high
overhead, was dim. Andr&eacute; caught glimpses of
shadowy faces stationed at windows and small
breaks in the walls. Rifles cracked, and a bazooka
at a far window flamed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in a German trap,&#8221; the lieutenant explained
to Andr&eacute; hastily. &#8220;I sent out for help. I
hope it comes. You get over in that manger, kid,
and keep down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the lieutenant turned to shout orders and
warnings to his men. &#8220;Don&#8217;t show yourself above
that window again, Donovan! You <i>want</i> to get
hit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two Heinies edgin&#8217; around that wall,&#8221;
screamed an unseen rifleman. &#8220;Watch it, Lieutenant!&#8221;</p>

<p>After a shattering fusilade of machine-gun fire
against the old stone walls, a sudden silence fell.
And outside, a German voice called, &#8220;Do you giff
up, or do we take you, vun by vun?&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence fell again. And then the bark of the
lieutenant&#8217;s automatic. Six rapid shots.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your answer, Fritzie boy!&#8221; Lieutenant
Ouvarski growled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>The voice outside did not speak again. The
lieutenant wiped his face on the sleeve of his shirt.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; thought, &#8220;I hope my mother and father
and Marie are in a deep stone cellar.&#8221; Then suddenly
he was too tired to remember why he was
there.</p>

<p>He did not even hear the corporal say, &#8220;What
does old Dobie think he&#8217;s doin&#8217; about those reinforcements
he promised? Sendin&#8217; &#8217;em by way of
Alaska?&#8221;</p>

<small><i>Patchou on the Battlefield</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">A</span> FEW minutes after Andr&eacute; left Victor, Captain
Dobie, Weller, their colonel, and his aide
were poring over a map. They were hidden under
trees, a mile and a half from the stone barn.</p>

<p>They looked up every moment or two toward
St. Sauveur.</p>

<p>&#8220;Things are going along fine,&#8221; the colonel said.
&#8220;The engineers have got a rubber pontoon bridge
over the Douve River, and troops are crossing
there already. They&#8217;ll have a steel one over the
river for the tanks to cross, in an hour or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dobie nodded. &#8220;How soon do you think we&#8217;ll
be sending our first patrols into St. Sauveur?&#8221; he
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;By sunset,&#8221; the colonel said. &#8220;As soon as the
9th gets the rest of these towns around here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
cleaned up, we&#8217;ll send our fellows through. How
are those new lieutenants I sent you, Dobie?&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie grinned. &#8220;Schoenfargle took
forty-seven prisoners yesterday. And Ouvarski&#8217;s
squad took over a hundred. That answer your
question, Colonel?&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel laughed. But his aide suddenly
held up a hand. &#8220;Wait a second. SOS of some kind
on the field telephone. Yes, yes ... I get you.
Yes. Ouvarski ... a dozen men. What? Trapped
in a barn.... Okay.... But where, man,
<i>where</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw the colonel reach out, and handed the
phone to him.</p>

<p>The colonel consulted the map and noted the
position of the barn. After a minute&#8217;s delay, he
got a battery commander by radio. Calmly, he
gave the map location.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have that stone barn boxed in by your guns,&#8221;
he ordered. &#8220;Fire for five minutes exactly&mdash;and
then quit. We&#8217;ll have relief troops ready to move
in then.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed the phone to Weller.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going down to the bridges now, Dobie,&#8221;
he said.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie looked white. &#8220;Ouvarski
trapped,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Can we spare enough men
right now to get them out, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>The aide said, &#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>The colonel put a thin, dirty hand on Dobie&#8217;s
arm. &#8220;You <i>know</i> we&#8217;ll get Ouvarski out. And my
orders to you, sir, are to stay right here. You have
my authority to make your man, Slim, a sergeant.
Send him in command of the Ouvarski rescue
bunch. Keep Weller with you. And <i>you</i>, Dobie,
in future, try not to be so all-fired brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain turned to catch Weller&#8217;s eye as the
colonel marched across the road to his own hidden
jeep.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sounds,&#8221; Dobie said, &#8220;a good deal like me
talking to Andr&eacute;, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>But his smile was short.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Slim&#8217;s a sergeant at last,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Get him
on the radio. Tell him to pick up fifteen or twenty
men and we&#8217;ll meet him down the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Captain,&#8221; Weller exploded, &#8220;the colonel
said&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouvarski&#8217;s my lieutenant, and a brave one. It&#8217;s
<i>my</i> job to see that he and his men get out alive,&#8221;
Dobie snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay, sir,&#8221; Weller said. &#8220;It&#8217;s me&#8217;ll get courtmartialed.
But pay no heed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jeep bounded and took to the road.</p>

<p>A few moments later they met Slim with a
truckload of men, and instructed him to follow.
They whirled past a ch&acirc;teau set on a hill, with a
scattering of cottages on its lower slopes.</p>

<p>Weller tilted rapidly around high stone walls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
and pulled up in the shelter of a cottage near the
ch&acirc;teau gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get any closer,&#8221; Weller said firmly.
&#8220;Ouvarski must be in that barn over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll stay here till the shelling that the colonel
ordered is over,&#8221; Dobie ordered.</p>

<p>Slim had his men out of the truck and ready to
move in.</p>

<p>Without warning, from unseen guns, a barrage
of shells circled the barn. The men crouched near
the jeep winced under the explosive pressure on
their ears.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie had been watching his stopwatch.
Five minutes later he said, &#8220;All right,
Slim, shelling&#8217;s over. Fan your men out, and take
those Nazis in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new sergeant and his men moved rapidly
ahead, skirting the cottage wall.</p>

<p>They had just disappeared around the corner
when Dobie cried sharply, &#8220;What in the name
of&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller had sprung headlong from the jeep and
lunged at a sunken doorway.</p>

<p>A moment later he returned, breathing hard,
with a dog in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Patchou!</i>&#8221; Dobie shouted.</p>

<p>Weller, his face tilted away from Patchou&#8217;s loving
tongue and scrambling paws, pitched the dog
into Captain Dobie&#8217;s lap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;If this means what I think it means,&#8221; he puffed
rapidly, &#8220;Andr&eacute;&#8217;s somewheres about. Maybe you
can figure it out, sir....&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting, he was gone, clanking with
grenades, his head lowered between determined
shoulders.</p>

<p>Straining forward in the jeep, Captain Dobie
sat raging at his helplessness. He knew he would
be useless in the field. He could barely walk. But
every rifle crack, every grenade explosion sent his
blood boiling. To think of Andr&eacute; exposed to all
this was a maddening extra anxiety.</p>

<p>He kept a hand on Patchou, who was torn between
the joy of reunion with an old friend, and
terror.</p>

<p>Dobie smoothed his fur absently while he directed
his binoculars toward the heavy firing about
the barn. He could not see much that was happening,
because of the cottage wall, and stared around
the fields. &#8220;If Andr&eacute;&#8217;ll only keep under cover till
this shooting stops,&#8221; Dobie thought.</p>

<p>He stiffened at the smell of timbers burning,
and looked back to the barn quickly.</p>

<p>Slim appeared around the corner of the cottage
and ran up toward Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cap&#8217;n,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;More&mdash;&#8221; He stopped and
stared wildly. &#8220;What&#8217;s that dawg! That ain&#8217;t&mdash;<i>It
is</i> Patchou! Well, for cryin&#8217; out&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;<i>More what?</i>&#8221; the captain snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;More trouble, Cap&#8217;n. The barn&#8217;s afire in one
corner. An&#8217; we ain&#8217;t got half the Germans yet.
They&#8217;re hid everywhere. If Ouvarski and the men
have to make a break for it, there&#8217;s still enough
Nazis to pick &#8217;em all off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dobie reached for the radio switch. Turning to
Slim, he barked instructions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll order smoke shells to cover their escape.
Go out there and warn the men to pull back a little.
Where&#8217;s Weller?&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim poised on one foot to answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fightin&#8217; mad&mdash;an&#8217; he&#8217;s fightin&#8217; good.&#8221;</p>

<p>He disappeared into a thicket to carry out the
captain&#8217;s order. Dobie spoke rapidly into the radio
and then signed off.</p>

<p>For a while he sat listening, and watching the
smoke billow high above a gable of the barn.</p>

<p>He heard loud, sputtered German orders. Then
came renewed rifle bursts, and a grenade exploded
near by.</p>

<p>Just before the outburst, Patchou gave a high,
excited yelp and leaped from the jeep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patchou!&#8221; Captain Dobie shouted furiously.
&#8220;Come here, boy. <i>Patchou!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog streaked, with flying tail, back toward
the ch&acirc;teau gates, stretched to his utmost to cover
ground.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>With piercing yelps of delight he jumped into
the arms of a girl. She had turned at his barking
and then suddenly run to meet him.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie regarded the slim figure with
amazement. Slacks, army jacket, man&#8217;s cap from
which soft black hair like Andr&eacute;&#8217;s escaped. And
the same gray-blue eyes.</p>

<p>A flash of enlightenment burst over Dobie.</p>

<p>Irritated to fury, he muttered, &#8220;Jumping Jehosophat!
Now we have <i>Marie</i> Gagnon!&#8221;</p>

<small><i>The Secret Tunnel</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">C</span>APTAIN DOBIE&#8217;S heart and thoughts were
with the men under his command. Beyond that,
he was desperately aware of great armies fighting
a hard battle near by.</p>

<p>Seeing Marie here, knowing Andr&eacute; was also in
the battle area, he thought angrily, &#8220;This is too
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ma&#8217;moiselle,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;this is no place for
you. Find cover immediately!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie looked up. &#8220;You do not understand,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;This dog belongs to my brother. Andr&eacute;
must be here somewhere. Patchou couldn&#8217;t get
this far alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>do</i> know,&#8221; replied the captain. &#8220;Get under
that gateway quickly&mdash;and <i>hold</i> that dog.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Marie crouched under the arch, he explained
quickly how he had come to know Andr&eacute;.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Marie said nervously, &#8220;You haven&#8217;t seen him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Since I left your home, I have not.&#8221; The
captain&#8217;s voice was sharp with anxiety. &#8220;And I
haven&#8217;t time to look for him now. My men are in
that burning barn with Germans all around it.
I&#8217;ve ordered covering smoke shells dropped to
help them escape. And I can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s
held the shells up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated. Looking with deep concern at
Marie, he spoke more gruffly. &#8220;I&#8217;m just afraid
there&#8217;s a good chance Andr&eacute; may be in that barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie ran out a step or two and pointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In <i>that</i> barn?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh! I can get him
out then. Come, Patchou!&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie stood up and shouted, but Marie
and Patchou had disappeared through the cottage
door&mdash;not across the field.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie sank back, fuming. The flames
were spreading across the barn roof. He switched
on the radio and waited irritably. When there was
no response, he reached back into the jeep for
grenades which he hooked into his belt.</p>

<p>He had just grasped his gun firmly, and gingerly
lowered a leg to the ground, when Patchou barked
and wriggled out of the cottage door.</p>

<p>At the same instant Slim came around the garden
wall and stopped in his tracks, staring at the
doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouvarski!&#8221; he shouted and then, &#8220;<i>Andr&eacute;!</i>&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Captain Dobie&#8217;s head snapped toward the cottage.</p>

<p>A tall officer stood behind Patchou, and with
him was Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Behind Lieutenant Ouvarski and Andr&eacute; straggled
several dusty, smoke-blackened men. They
moved a few steps forward.</p>

<p>Ouvarski steadied himself against a stone pillar.
Marie and two of the men eased a wounded soldier
they were carrying, to the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; Ouvarski said hoarsely, &#8220;can you
get medics? Three wounded&mdash;one badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie swallowed hard. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All others accounted for, sir,&#8221; Ouvarski reported.
&#8220;No worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not any of you are accounted for,&#8221; the captain
growled. &#8220;How did you get <i>here</i>? I thought you
were in that blasted barn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim gasped as Marie, finished with making her
patient more easy, walked forward.</p>

<p>Ouvarski simply threw out a hand toward
Marie, and said, &#8220;She led us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie walked up to Captain Dobie.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a tunnel to the barn from this gardener&#8217;s
cottage, sir,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have
time to tell you before. The tunnel is old, but it is
open. The Maquis have been using it for months,
partly for wounded men. The barn was our headquarters.
We just moved out yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_156.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Marie came up through the old tunnel</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>Captain Dobie nodded, speechless with relief.
He pushed back his helmet, mopped his forehead,
and switched on the radio. &#8220;I&#8217;ll cancel those smoke
shells,&#8221; he muttered.</p>

<p>At that moment the air overhead whined
ominously. A curtain of shells fell around the barn
and exploded. A dense pall of white smoke drifted
across the field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Weller?&#8221; the captain asked Slim.
&#8220;And what about the Nazis still around that
barn?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by grenade and rifle fire and
the thrashing of men breaking through shrubbery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Watch it!&#8221; Weller&#8217;s voice rang above the din.</p>

<p>The shooting stopped suddenly, and German
and American voices mingled.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie listened a moment, smiled, and
switched on the radio.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks for the smoke shells,&#8221; he said into the
receiver. He switched through to his command
post. &#8220;Say, send along a couple of trucks for prisoners.
And a medic and ambulance. At least three
wounded here&mdash;one pretty bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned back to the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Ouvarski,&#8221; he said pleasantly, &#8220;I certainly
sent you into something. Headquarters said
positively no Germans left in this area.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They came out of this ch&acirc;teau and we had to
take cover in the barn, sir,&#8221; Ouvarski said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>&#8220;Take it easy,&#8221; Dobie said, &#8220;all of you, till the
trucks get here. Sergeant! What ails <i>you</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller limped into sight along the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve about cleaned &#8217;em all out&mdash;finally,&#8221; he
grinned.</p>

<p>Dobie frowned. &#8220;But what happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Got myself a bullet.&#8221; Weller&#8217;s smile broadened
and turned into a grimace of pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I told you to stay away from those
Germans,&#8221; Dobie barked.</p>

<p>Weller limped painfully to the jeep and Slim
spun him gently around and into the back seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure did, sir,&#8221; Weller said. &#8220;But you forgot
to tell them Germans to keep away from me.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_158.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Not far behind Weller, a line of Nazi prisoners
were coming across the field, hands on head. With
them, on each side, strode Americans with Tommy
guns ready.</p>

<p>Marie was examining the injury to Weller&#8217;s leg.</p>

<p>&#8220;That bullet will have to be taken out,&#8221; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not in very deep. It won&#8217;t hurt much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gonna stay right there,&#8221; Weller said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
probably the only proof I&#8217;ll have to show my kids
I was ever in this war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had been saying, &#8220;Sir,&#8221; at intervals. But
he had trouble saying it loud enough to make the
captain hear.</p>

<p>When the prisoners had been herded together
under guard a little distance away, Captain Dobie
sank back in his seat and smiled down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Andr&eacute;,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m too glad to see you alive
to tell you what I ought to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; felt his face grow red. &#8220;I wanted to try
to get my father and mother home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been simpler for all of us if you
had waited,&#8221; replied the captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t, sir,&#8221; Andr&eacute; said staunchly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Patchou hadn&#8217;t been here, Captain,&#8221; Marie
said, &#8220;I might have missed Andr&eacute;. It was Patchou
who found <i>me</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dog, at the sound of his name, tossed up his
head. Then he sniffed deeply, and whirled in the
direction of the ch&acirc;teau gates, paused a brief second,
and shot away at an excited gallop.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie could only say, &#8220;<i>Now</i> what?&#8221;</p>

<small><i>The 82nd Finishes Its Fight</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">T</span>HE building which had housed the patients
from the St. Sauveur hospital for a week was being
emptied hastily.</p>

<p>A plump older nurse was helping the sick who
could walk. Hurrying them into their wraps, she
bustled them out to a line of waiting, ancient cars.</p>

<p>Doctors were aiding the more helpless patients.</p>

<p>All of them froze like statues when a shell
crashed near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since dawn,&#8221; scolded the nurse, &#8220;this racket
has been going on. Now, one foot up into the car,
dear. Now the other. That&#8217;s my good girl. <i>Bon
voyage.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The last to leave were the Gagnons. Pierre
walked slowly toward the door with his arm
around Mme. Gagnon. She moved stiffly, but without
pain.</p>

<p>At the door a doctor smiled at them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Do not worry about madame, M. Gagnon,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;She is greatly improved. I expect no more
difficulties for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Merci</i>, doctor,&#8221; Pierre replied gruffly.</p>

<p>The doctor peered around the door. &#8220;I see that
M. Angell is waiting for you in his car. I&#8217;m sure
you will find his house a fortress of safety.&#8221;</p>

<p>His words were drowned in the shriek and explosion
of a second shell, and the rending crash of
roof timbers. The blast hurtled the three of them
into a corner. A shower of falling lath and plaster
filled the room.</p>

<p>The doctor and Pierre pulled Mme. Gagnon to
her feet.</p>

<p>From outside, the desperate voice of the car
driver shrieked, &#8220;Hurry, doctor! Come at once! I
do not intend to wait till another explosion hits
my car.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mme. Gagnon shook herself and with great
dignity stated firmly, &#8220;I can walk. Observe your
own step, Pierre. You, also, doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She crossed the shattered porch and went down
the steps. Pierre and the doctor raced to help her
into the conveyance.</p>

<p>At the slam of the door, M. Angell was prepared,
and the car leaped forward through the gates and
into the lane.</p>

<p>Pierre gasped for breath. &#8220;I hope your home is
safe,&#8221; he said hoarsely.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;No place is safe today,&#8221; the driver retorted
over his shoulder, swinging the battered old car
expertly around curves.</p>

<p>Braced as well as she could manage, Mme. Gagnon
looked out with horror on the countryside.</p>

<p>&#8220;My son and my daughter!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Could
they exist through such warfare as this? I must
know, Pierre. It is worse than I imagined.&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor spoke soothingly, but broke off to
shout, &#8220;Angell. Watch yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>A soldier had stepped out from the shelter of a
ditch with upraised hand. &#8220;You must detour,&#8221; he
said in French. &#8220;This lane and the road beyond are
mined.&#8221; He pointed to one side. &#8220;Those fields are
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Angell muttered and nosed the car cautiously
into the pasture. Circling shell holes, rocking
over hummocks, he steered toward a shallow
depression some distance ahead. After that he
forced the car up a rise.</p>

<p>As they neared the top, the sound of machine
guns and rifle fire, which had been muffled,
seemed to explode all around them.</p>

<p>M. Angell brought the steaming car to a stop.
He surveyed the landscape on all sides.</p>

<p>After a moment he said, &#8220;If you will be kind
enough to alight, I shall lead you to safety&mdash;but
on your own feet. We must abandon this vehicle
to the mercies of Heaven.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Mme. Gagnon said to the doctor, &#8220;It is cause for
rejoicing, doctor, that your cure was successful and
I <i>can</i> walk. Stop frowning, Pierre. Each step I take
leads toward home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the moment,&#8221; snapped M. Angell, &#8220;our
steps lead down that slope on the left, toward those
cottages. That path,&#8221; and he pointed to the ch&acirc;teau,
&#8220;leads to my house, but firing of considerable
intensity is going on there.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_163.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A tremendous salvo of shells interrupted. Dense
white smoke rolled over the hill and drifted
through the trees lining the driveway to the ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds as though we were moving directly
into the middle of a battle,&#8221; Mme. Gagnon said.</p>

<p>M. Angell raised his head. &#8220;There is a skirmish
there on the other side of the hill, which I do not
understand,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Pierre Gagnon stared around.</p>

<p>At a fresh outbreak of gunfire Mme. Gagnon
begged him to lower himself.</p>

<p>But Pierre&#8217;s eyes were fixed wildly on a point
near the cottages. His mouth dropped open and
closed again excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maman!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Patchou! I see Patchou!&#8221;</p>

<p>The doctor and M. Angell turned to him in
alarm.</p>

<p>Mme. Gagnon stood up. &#8220;I do not see Patchou,&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;But if he is here, certainly Andr&eacute; must
be near.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly the vague noises broke into a noisy
scuffle on the rocky, brush-covered knoll above
them. German and American voices rang out
angrily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is unbearable!&#8221; Mme. Gagnon cried. &#8220;I
must find Andr&eacute;!&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke and ran.</p>

<p>Pierre gave a lunge. He caught his wife&#8217;s sleeve
and was about to pull her to the ground when a
racing dog, like a tornado, streaked up the slope.</p>

<p>Patchou danced to Pierre and then to Mme.
Gagnon, lathering their hands in rapturous welcome,
yelping shrilly.</p>

<p>An American soldier, his shoulders sagging with
fatigue, came out of the underbrush. He frowned
at the group. &#8220;What&#8217;re you folks doing out here?&#8221;
he demanded. &#8220;You better come along with me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>The doctor&mdash;the only one of the Normans who
understood English&mdash;said, &#8220;Yes. Most certainly
we do not wish to stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The American started down the slope. Mme.
Gagnon and Pierre, attended by the two other
men, followed.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Pierre,&#8221; Mme. Gagnon protested, &#8220;why do
we follow them? Did Patchou come this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Patchou answered this by tearing ahead with
great purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said Pierre.</p>

<p>At the foot of the slope the American pushed
his way through a break in the hawthornes. At
his heels, M. Angell and the doctor gallantly pulled
the bushes apart for Mme. Gagnon.</p>

<p>She took a step forward and stood still, a hand
clasped to her heart.</p>

<p>Not twenty feet away, standing near a jeep and
a cluster of soldiers, were Andr&eacute; and Marie.</p>

<p>At the same instant Andr&eacute; and Marie saw her.
And Andr&eacute; hurled himself toward his mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew I would find you!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I <i>knew</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie and Pierre drew into the family embrace.</p>

<p>Slim and Weller turned to catch each other&#8217;s
eye. &#8220;The kid done it,&#8221; Weller said.</p>

<p>Slim sighed. &#8220;I shore wish I had that trumpet
now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I feel awful sentimental.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie sat back and smoked, watching
the happy reunion of the Gagnon family.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>When the doctor and M. Angell left to start up
the hill Marie broke away from the family to run
after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Monsieur Angell,&#8221; she called, &#8220;I must tell
you how sorry I am your barn was burned. It was
so useful to the Maquis. We are grateful to you for
letting us use it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is nothing,&#8221; M. Angell replied courteously.
&#8220;It was for France. However, if you will accept
advice from a stranger, I suggest that you now return
home with your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marie smiled. &#8220;I quite agree with you, M&#8217;sieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>Within a few minutes, trucks and ambulances
drew up. The wounded, both American and German,
were cared for and taken away.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_166.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Weller and Captain Dobie resisted the suggestions
of the medics to go back in the ambulance.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want no pamperin&#8217;,&#8221; Weller said
shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m only nicked, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fighting squads clambered aboard trucks
to return to the St. Sauveur front.</p>

<p>The captain leaned from the jeep to talk more
easily with Mme. Gagnon and Pierre.</p>

<p>The radio in the car squawked insistently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Answer that signal, will you, Weller?&#8221; Captain
Dobie said.</p>

<p>Weller snapped a switch, said, &#8220;Okay, Colonel,&#8221;
and gave his report on Ouvarski&#8217;s rescue.</p>

<p>Then he listened a few minutes and exclaimed,
&#8220;Yes, Colonel ... I&#8217;ll tell the cap&#8217;n. Sure will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie had stopped talking to listen to
Weller.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; asked curiously, &#8220;Good news?&#8221;</p>

<p>Weller almost shouted, &#8220;Our armies are cleanin&#8217;
up St. Sauveur, and the 47th&#8217;re movin&#8217; on past&mdash;headin&#8217;
for the coast an&#8217; then Cherbourg.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; said Dobie. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221; Weller grinned. &#8220;The colonel says the
82nd won&#8217;t be goin&#8217; on to Cherbourg with the 9th
Division. We&#8217;re ordered to take the marshy country
south of St. Sauveur. <i>An&#8217; after that we&#8217;ll get
relieved.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The 82nd will be out of the war?&#8221; Dobie
asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;Every bloomin&#8217; man of us,&#8221; Weller replied.
&#8220;An&#8217; that means you, too, Cap&#8217;n.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim winked at Andr&eacute;. &#8220;I guess that means you,
too, kid,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie rubbed his hand across his eyes,
and said, &#8220;After over two weeks of steady fighting
I guess the 82nd deserves a rest. Well, give me that
phone, Weller.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he had finished his call he said to Pierre,
&#8220;I have sent for a jeep to take you home, M. Gagnon.
Do you think you can hang onto Andr&eacute; till
the jeep gets here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre threw back his head in his great, bellowing
laugh. &#8220;I think so, <i>mon Capitaine</i>,&#8221; he roared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, kid,&#8221; Weller said. &#8220;I promise
you we&#8217;ll be back. We&#8217;ll see you in a week&#8217;r two.
You just save us some of that good fresh milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pierre clapped his hand to his head and glared
at Andr&eacute;.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon Dieu!</i>&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;The cows!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY<br />


<small><i>Bastille Day&mdash;1944</i></small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="xxlarge">T</span>HAT night, lights glowed in the Gagnon
house. In spite of the blustery cold wind and
drifts of rain, the door stood open most of the
evening.</p>

<p>Friends came, laughing, crying, chattering greetings
and news. Children came to ask Andr&eacute; questions
and stand with open mouths at what he had
to say.</p>

<p>Marie brought cups of hot chocolate and black
bread. Mme. Lescot supplied some small cakes.</p>

<p>Leon Duplis rode over to tell Marie that General
de Gaulle, who commanded the Maquis from
London, was now touring the liberated towns of
Normandy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The French Army will soon join the fight to
free our country,&#8221; Leon whispered to Marie.
&#8220;They will enter France from the Mediterranean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
But do not tell anyone yet I said so.&#8221; And with that
he was on his motor bike and gone.</p>

<p>On the road outside, traffic was coming up from
the beach, but in smaller convoys. &#8220;The sea is
getting very rough,&#8221; someone reported.</p>

<p>By midnight all the guests had gone and the
whole family were in bed&mdash;really home at last.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; went out to the road many times the next
few days to look for friends on the army trucks and
jeeps rolling by. On the third day, a messenger
from St. Sauveur, on his way to the supply dumps
on the beach, stopped to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;We got the peninsula cut off now,&#8221; he reported.
&#8220;The 9th Division an&#8217; the 79th an&#8217; the
4th Division are on their way to Cherbourg. Goin&#8217;
fast, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Captain Dobie&#8217;s men were still fighting for the
marshes and some hills west and south of St.
Sauveur, he said.</p>

<p>The storm over the Channel had built up to an
alarming degree. Rain and wind whipped the
trees along the coast and drove the villagers indoors.
Traffic past the house slowed almost to a
stop.</p>

<p>When Andr&eacute; asked a truck driver what was happening
on the beaches, the driver said, &#8220;A blasted
hurricane. The sea is standin&#8217; on end. No landin&#8217;
barges can get ashore. Pretty bad, &#8217;cause General
Bradley&#8217;s howlin&#8217; for ammunition.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Frenchmen coming to the village from the shore
said tons of supplies had been swept away and
sunk.</p>

<p>The storm raged for four days, and Andr&eacute; went
sadly about his duties watching the road now
nearly empty of trucks.</p>

<p>Two days after the storm subsided, Andr&eacute;
heard that General Eisenhower had ferried across
the Channel to look over the destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll talk to them army engineers an&#8217; get deliveries
speeded up&mdash;or else,&#8221; a soldier said.</p>

<p>But the Americans were driving hard to capture
Cherbourg. They needed the port more than
ever since the storm had stopped supplies coming
across the beaches.</p>

<p>On June 28th, Leon came, and shouted through
the door, &#8220;Andr&eacute;! Marie! <i>Cherbourg has fallen.</i>
Normandy belongs to us again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, on D-day plus 29&mdash;four weeks after the
82nd paratroopers had first drifted down into the
Gagnon orchard&mdash;Slim clattered up in a jeep.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; saw him from the hallway and raced out
to grab his hand and pump it up and down&mdash;as
the soldiers did. He asked, &#8220;Where are Captain
Dobie and Sergeant Weller? Has the 82nd been
relieved? Did you win your battle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you mean, mister?&#8221; Slim growled. &#8220;Did
we win our battle? The 82nd always wins its battles&mdash;Africa,
Sicily, Normandy. You know that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Andr&eacute; took Slim into the house to see the rest
of the family. He translated Slim&#8217;s &#8220;American&#8221; as
well as he could for his father and mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my last errand this way,&#8221; Slim told
them. &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way to the Utah airstrip to fix
the cap&#8217;n&#8217;s passage home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he left, he promised to bring Weller and
the captain to see them on the way to the plane.</p>

<p>The storm had at last blown itself out, and
traffic on the road was again heavy. Now the Allies
were getting ready to break through to Paris&mdash;to
free the rest of France. The British and Canadians
were fighting hard around Caen. The Germans
were bringing up more and more tanks&mdash;better in
some ways than the British and American ones&mdash;and
the battle was rough. But the Invasion armies
were moving toward the breakout into the farther
parts of France. The spirit of Liberty swept slowly
but excitedly across all Normandy.</p>

<p>July 14th, Bastille Day, which was the symbol
of French Liberty, would soon be here.</p>

<p>&#8220;This year we will celebrate Bastille Day with
good heart,&#8221; said M. Blanc to Father Duprey.</p>

<p>And Father Duprey, who was very practical,
asked, &#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that I have thought about,&#8221; M. Blanc
answered. &#8220;And I have a plan for our little village.
Alone, we cannot do justice to such a great event
as this Liberation. We will join with Ste. M&egrave;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
&Eacute;glise to celebrate. We are not without talent in
this village.&#8221; He looked mysterious and whispered
his plans to the priest, so that no one could overhear.</p>

<p>When they had finished their discussion, Father
Duprey said, &#8220;Your plan will also keep the children
out of the fields till the German land mines
have been cleared up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The following few days there was a great hubbub
in the loft of the Gagnon barn. Children&#8217;s
voices rang out. And music billowed over the rooftops.</p>

<p>Early one morning, Father Duprey summoned
Andr&eacute;. Victor appeared with his cart, and with the
priest and Andr&eacute; jogged off, behaving mysteriously,
to talk to the mayor of Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise.</p>

<p>Bastille Day, Friday, July 14th, was the next
day. By sunrise that morning all the little villages
near Ste. M&egrave;re were alive with activity.</p>

<p>Mothers bustled breakfast into their families
and packed up lunch baskets. Older sisters swept
the family&#8217;s best clothes, all nicely aired, over the
heads of the younger children. Then mothers and
big sisters pulled and twisted themselves into
their own gayest Normandy dresses. Fathers put
on the dark suits they had been married in.</p>

<p>And all over the peninsula the French tricolor
flags, which had been hidden away, flew in great
flapping bursts of triumph from every house.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>All churchbells that had survived the bombing
began to ring soon after the sun was up.</p>

<p>In the Gagnon house, Maman was scurrying
about, her own silk dress rustling as excitedly as
she was. Marie, too, rustled in her new pale-yellow
parachute gown.</p>

<p>Old cars had been rolled out of sheds where
they had been hidden, and somehow brought to
life. They began to ease into the busy military
traffic and headed for Ste. M&egrave;re. Carts, bright with
flags and flowers, and loaded with chattering villagers,
thronged the roads.</p>

<p>Father Duprey and M. Blanc had gone to Ste.
M&egrave;re still earlier in a borrowed car.</p>

<p>In good time, Victor, Mme. Lescot, and their
daughter showed up at the Gagnon door with La
Fum&eacute;e. The fat Percheron whinnied when Andr&eacute;
led the family out to jam themselves into the cart.</p>

<p>When La Fum&eacute;e entered the outskirts of Ste.
M&egrave;re the town was already aflame with a noisy
celebration.</p>

<p>Victor found a spot where La Fum&eacute;e could be
hitched to a post with a pail of water beside her.</p>

<p>In the heart of Ste. M&egrave;re &Eacute;glise the square was
a churning mass of people. But in a cleared space
in the center of the green, officials and police were
arranging things in an orderly way. There was a
flag-draped table on a raised platform, and rows
of chairs for special personages stood in a square.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>At one side of the table, dignitaries were gathering.
At the other side, M. Blanc and the Ste. M&egrave;re
music master were herding the children who were
to sing, into neat rows.</p>

<p>Running to join the children, Andr&eacute; saw uniformed
French officers in a group among the
dignitaries. All eyes were upon them. Farther back
stood a company of about a hundred American
soldiers.</p>

<p>Marie went to join Leon, Jacquard, and the
other Maquis who had been able to come.</p>

<p>When the hour for opening the ceremonies arrived,
Father Duprey and two other priests moved
to the table for prayers of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Then the mayor of Ste. M&egrave;re, and the mayors of
other villages made speeches. These over, the
music master blew his pitch pipe and M. Blanc
raised his arm to give the beat for the singing.
High and clear, the children&#8217;s voices sang out the
beloved old songs of triumphant France.</p>

<p>When the last song died away the children settled
down on the grass, and M. Blanc rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are now about to have a special pleasure,&#8221;
he announced. &#8220;Andr&eacute; Gagnon will express the
feeling of comradeship we all have for our friends,
the Americans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; had been carefully carrying his trumpet
under his arm. His knees shaking, he stepped forward
and put the trumpet to his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>He played first a gay little Normandy tune. This
was loudly applauded and he waited for the noise
to die down.</p>

<p>When he again trilled out a trumpet call, every
Frenchman present grew silent and listened with
puzzled eyes. The tune was one they didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the back of the crowd, men&#8217;s
voices began to sing the words.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute;&#8217;s heart gave a great leap. But he kept on
playing. The voices were growing louder. The
men were moving toward the green.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; swept into the chorus, and powerfully
the American words, punctuated by clapping
hands at the proper time, swelled out over the
crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>A French voice took up the words. Another and
another, until the entire gathering was singing.</p>

<p>Many of the Americans stood beside Andr&eacute;
now, and Slim, his hard hands beating the clap-clap
of the chorus, sang the loudest.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Deep in ze &#8217;eart ohff Tayxsas</i>,&#8221; sang the
French.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;<i>Stars at night are big and bright,</i></div>
<div class="indent">(clap-clap, clap-clap,) <i>Deep in the heart of Texas,</i></div>
</div>

<div class="verse"><i>Remind me of the one I love,</i></div>
<div class="indent">(clap-clap, clap-clap) <i>Deep in the heart of Texas,</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>sang Slim and Weller and Captain Dobie, dragging
out the last long notes at the thought of home.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_176.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Andr&eacute; dropped his trumpet to his side.</p>

<p>As the babble of happy voices rose and became
bedlam, Captain Dobie shook hands with the
French officers.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; started at the sight of a Royal Air Force
uniform and ran across the square.</p>

<p>Standing beside Marie, Ronald Pitt was laughing
with the Maquis over the escapade of the
strange &#8220;nun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ronald grabbed Andr&eacute;&#8217;s arms and swung him
merrily around.</p>

<p>&#8220;How did <i>you</i> get here, Ronald?&#8221; Andr&eacute; asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Ronald replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m on my way to the
British lines to chauffeur a general around&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-ohh,&#8221; Andr&eacute; giggled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw this celebration going on down here,&#8221;
Ronald Pitt went on, &#8220;and I wanted to see what
was happening in Ste. M&egrave;re. So I landed in a field
and trotted over&mdash;and look what I found!&#8221;</p>

<p>Slim and Weller joined them then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t we tell you we&#8217;d come?&#8221; demanded
Weller.</p>

<p>Softly, a song began to tremble from different
points among the crowd.</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; lifted his trumpet and began to play.</p>

<p>And swelling mightily over the battered roofs
of Ste. M&egrave;re rolled out the song of freedom that is
the voice of France&mdash;the &#8220;Marseillaise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Everyone sang and many wept.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>After that, the gathering broke up and lunch
baskets were opened. Mme. Gagnon beckoned
her enlarged family party together under the
shade of a wide chestnut tree. Lunch was spread
out. Between them, she and Mme. Lescot had
brought food enough for all.</p>

<p>Captain Dobie and Andr&eacute; sat side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will return to visit us after the war?&#8221;
Andr&eacute; asked shyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly will,&#8221; promised the captain. &#8220;I shall
come back whenever I can. I won&#8217;t be comfortable
unless I know what you&#8217;re up to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Andr&eacute; laughed. &#8220;And,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall go to
America some day to see that you have got that leg
mended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Vive les Americains!</i>&#8221; shouted Raoul, who had
mysteriously become one of the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Vive la French!</i>&#8221; shouted Weller.</p>

<p>La Fum&eacute;e heard them, and put her muzzle
down comfortably into the water pail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>About the Author</i></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clayton Knight</span> was born in Rochester, New York, and grew up just in
time to become an airplane pilot with the famed Lafayette Escadrille
in World War I. He also had a box seat for World War II in which he
served in every important theater of war as an Associated Press special
correspondent. His lifelong, active interest in aviation has earned him
many honors and taken him to almost every corner of the earth, most
recently on a round-the-world trip collecting material for an official history
of the Military Air Transport Service. It has also provided him with
fascinating material for a distinguished list of books and magazine stories
that have made him well known both to young people and adults, not
only as an author but an artist of uncommon distinction.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><i>About the Historical Consultant</i></h2>

<p>Few experts are as well qualified as <span class="smcap">Major General Ralph Royce</span> to
pass on the merits of a book about the Normandy invasion. As Deputy
Commander of the Ninth Air Force, he was the senior air officer afloat
during the invasion of France and served aboard the cruiser <i>Augusta</i>
with Admiral Kirk and General Bradley. He accompanied General Bradley
to shore at Utah Beach and, in the days that followed, reconnoitered
the surrounding country very thoroughly, visiting many of the towns
mentioned in this book. In General Royce&#8217;s words, &#8220;Mr. Knight&#8217;s book
brings back very vividly the life that we lived during those hectic and exciting
days in June, 1944, and portrays extremely well the life of the
countryside during those early hours of the invasion that led to the freeing
of France from the yoke of the invader.&#8221;</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
